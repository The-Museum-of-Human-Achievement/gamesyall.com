				Crimp Team is a collection of local Austin devs who met rock climbing. For the last few years we've been excited to plan long weekend trips to jam together at AirBnbs in the privacy of rural Texas. Wormspell is our 5th game together and you can get it for free on Itch.io along with our past games: Honked! a clown noir, Gob N' Go, Card Cowboy, and Crash Land Crystal.

              Andrew (SmartAlloc) works as a software engineer and game developer, while moonlighting as an indie game developer, his true passion. For over a decade, Andrew has been developing games for the smallest and most restrictive environments - from calculators to washing machines to chatbots. Now he develops for the Pico-8, where he strives to create fun and deep games which can be compressed down to fit within the pixels of a 120x120 png file.
