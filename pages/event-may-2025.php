                    <p>currentarchive is a poetic net art project that reflects my research process as a mixed, diasporic anishinaabe. It animates the senses of obscurity, denial, and loss that often define searches for indigeneity in institutional spaces (and sometimes daily life). i altered photographic, audio, and textual material from my own experience and family history to subvert the oppressive practices of redaction and obfuscation. currentarchive is entwined with refusal‚Äîfirst to be recognized, and then to be dismissed.</p>

                    <p>Ashcroft is a narrative-driven, psychological horror game being built through Bitsy with Twine integration. It follows two women of different eras - one in the present day and one in the late 1800s. Playing as Lesly, we follow her story as the new Dorm Manager for an all-girls residence hall in Texas. As strange happenings in the house put her on edge, she begins to unravel the story of Eliza, one of the first owners, whose traumatic past led to the current state of the Ashcroft dormitory. </p>

                    Twisted Lavender is an indie studio created by Nina Martinez and Lindsay Howard to explore different storytelling formats and genres. If its a little creepy, spooky, and has some female rage, it's definitely up our alley. Our first and inaugural title, ASHCROFT, is a Twisty retro pixel horror game featuring a fully voiced cast. Twisted Lavender is developing an anthology of small games based within the ASHCROFT universe. 
                    <br><br>
                    The Twisted Lavender team is currently comprised of three people: Nina Martinez, Lindsay, Howard, and Lily Peterson. Nina met Lindsay in college where they bonded over their love of games. After they began production, Nina and Lindsay brought Lily Peterson on as a Programmer to help bring their spooky ideas to life.

                        We're a group of friends who have been working on this project remotely for about five months. What started as a short term project grew in scope once we realized its potential. We're now aiming to publish this game as our first ever commercial steam title. Above all, our biggest commitments are making a game that we're proud of and refining our skills even further.

However, each night the ship seems to twist and turn against you and its walls sound less like its creaking but breathing. However, no matter what you might see, no matter what you might hear‚Ä¶ YOU.

                        Hi! We are a group of college students and aspiring game developers who developed this horror game in under 15 weeks for our video game capstone class. We wanted to tackle the challenge of making a retro horror aesthetic reminiscent of old PlayStation graphics. We are a mix of VFX artists, 3D Modelers, programmers, and me as the producer and we're super passionate about continuing to develop the game! 
                    </p>
