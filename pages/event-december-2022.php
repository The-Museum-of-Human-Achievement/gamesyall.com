                <h4>Yoko Redux: Dreams of a Blue Planet</h4>
                <p>Yoko Redux: Dreams of a Blue Planet is driven by a rich, often cryptic, story as you control one of three main characters over the course of seven immersive chapters. The story takes you down the paths of Locke, Jeanne and Primus in a world just waiting to be discovered and cracked open. 
 <br><br>
Follow along on a progression through the psychedelic in multiple color palettes. Try to hold on to your sanity through mind bending visuals, cinematic camera angles and logic twisting story and you may discover...who is Yoko?

                <h4>The Living Space</h4>
                <p>
                  The Living Space is a first-person immersive experience which relies heavily on surreal visuals and dream-like sounds. Allowing players to freely roam at their own pace with no defined goals, the environment within the game alters, visually and aurally, based on the player‚Äôs gaze and movement. Your surroundings change depending on what areas you go to, yet their locations are not given to you or defined. Thus, the game doesn‚Äôt explicitly tell a single story but invites players to explore, look, listen, and take their time, nurturing their own story. 
<br><br>
Costas Constantinides is a game developer and illustration artist who creates surreal experiences and art inspired by folklore and fantasy. His work consists of intricate and mythical illustrations, and dream-like games. In his games, he seeks to combine his illustration work with digital environments and visual effects to amplify the experience.

                <h4>The Barnacle Goose Experiment</h4>
                <p>The Barnacle Goose Experiment is an abiogenesis idle clicker game, set in a world where spontaneous generation is commonplace.
<br><br>
You play as a researcher studying the creation of new and living things out of raw and non-living matter. In order to undertake this work without experimental contamination, you are locked inside of a hermetically sealed dome‚Äî entirely empty. As such, the only raw material for experimentation is that of your own body.
<br><br>
Through the accretions of self, the slow learning of mechanical systems, and the simple duration of time, you must uncover the combinatory logic of spontaneous generation and make again a living world from a dead one.

values? Where (white) men and women looked for love for the Right Reasons? Whatever happened to
our heteronormative representation? The pure symbol of the rose?
<br> <br>
The solution? Break it even more! Take advantage of its greatest (and messiest) product, Bachelor in
Paradise, put it in the Sims 4, and turn it into a study on AI and the construction of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù narratives
through editing, addition, and omission.
