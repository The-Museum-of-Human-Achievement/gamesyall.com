				        Recombobulator Games is a small indie company founded by a AAA veteran that wants nothing to do with scummy monetization practices currently employed by AAA companies. We want nothing more than to make great quality games that hearken back to the golden years of gaming but with modern themes and technology. 
                <br><br>
                Luis Alonso founded Recombobulator Games in August of 2020 (during the Covid-19 pandemic). He has been a game developer for over 20 years and brings knowledge from a number of AAA productions (i.e.: Mass Effect 3, Dead Space 2, Need For Speed: Nitro, Thief, etc.) He has been in the role of: animator, FX artist, shader artist, environment modeler, character modeler, technical artist, technical animator, technical director of art, and stress casualty. Additionally, he holds a degree in accounting, so he is counting every penny to make his dear game Space Boat, a reality.
