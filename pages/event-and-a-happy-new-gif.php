☁️🌵 Swing your Partner 🌵☁️
<br>
○ Howdy Y’all! This channel is shared between the Fantastic Arcade and The Museum of Human Achievement Discord servers so game devs and artists can hang out and make stuff together.
<br>
○ We’re using Connections Bot, which has some quirks. Emoji reactions are turned off, but other features seem to work fine. Let us know if anything seems funky.
<br><br>

🎨 Animated GIFs?! 🎨 
<br>
○ Even if you’ve never made a GIF before, we encourage you to join in and give it a shot!
<br>
○ GIFs can be made on a computer or smartphone from photos, drawings, pixel art, game engine exports, screenshots, video clips, etc.
<br>
○ Try opening a .gif in Photoshop or Gimp to see what its guts look like. You can “remix” an 
existing GIF this way by altering the individual frames of the animation
