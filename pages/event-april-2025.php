                    <p>a side view of a yellow car, is a tiny artistic web project I started in the context of the Welcome to My Homepage Residency. The aim is to experiment and toy with accessibility features such as alt text, audio transcription, but also low-tech media loaders designed for people with low-connectivity internet. The result is this intimate one-page website that features pictures of yellow cars alongside personal reflections on digital imagery in the age of self-driving cars. The website implements multiple accessibility features: an image loader that displays pixelated images by default with an added grainy aesthetic, a contextualized audio transcription of the page, and alt text for all images written in 5-7-5 short poem format.</p>

                <p>
                    Kaspar Ravel (they/them) is an artist, teacher, and researcher in tactical new media. Their work draws from a tradition of art movements set in between symbolic activism and practical approaches (from subtle gestures to concrete actions). As a self-taught coder and DIY hacker, their intention is to demystify technology, which brings them to encourage low-tech cultures and digital literacy in educational contexts, such as workshops, tutorials and micro-edition. Today, they aspire to develop discursive and programmatic tools for resistance against the veil of big data and globalised surveillance. Their research takes the form of 'poelitical' experiments, merging poetic expression with political critique within on/offline artworks.

Inspired by coffee ceremonies and the verbal art of well-wishing from their shared homeland of Ethiopia, the artists created this project to cultivate a new practice of collective care-taking for virtual space. 
                    <br><br>
                    The website allows visitors to receive blessings on topics ranging from world woes to future hopes, or to receive a customized blessing based on their specific concern. Sharing a wealth of knowledge about the practice of well-wishing, the project invites visitors to bring ·àù·à≠·âÉ·âµ (mirik‚Äôat) into their lives to experience the sense of wellbeing and interconnectedness that come with rooting for each other and honoring interdependence.

                DemureSoft is a doujinsoft circle based in Austin, TX, formed by Jennifer Raye to reject the bleak and cynical outlooks of making independent video games. We're carving a new path, one which we hope will inspire others to never lose sight of their passions, and to shout them brilliantly from the rooftops. We strive to push the agendas of bishoujo, eroge, and doujin in America. We will not rest until our city looks like Akihabara.
