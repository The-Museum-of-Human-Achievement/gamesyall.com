                <h4>"We'll make a car out of anything!!"</h4>
<p>Hot Wheels "We'll make a car out of anything!!!" Build-A-Car Photo Studio is a take on how ridiculous and over-the-top games and marketing for kids can get. This "game" isn't endorsed by Hot Wheels or Mattel (please don't sue Kristine) but it hopes to capture the essence of Hot Wheels' big car energy as well as paying homage to how sometimes the configurator in a game might be the most fun part.

Kristine Fernandez is a web developer and artist with a focus on creative coding. Lately that has meant developing mini games / experiences that aren't necessarily supposed to be fun but instead are explorations of a concept and breaking something intangible and/or complex into something more tangible, immersive, and engaging like a game.

<p>Nightingale is a short form horror game with some light puzzle elements developed for the Playdate. (Entirely in pulp!) It's about what it means to feel safe in your own body, inspired mostly by my experiences with auto-immune conditions. Expected release September 2023. CW for mild blood, R-rated language, and implied child abuse/neglect.

                <h4>Dyebreaker</h4>
                <p>Dyebreaker is a two-button ‚Äúair hockey platformer‚Äù with visuals inspired by screen print posters and the Game Boy Color. Two teams jump around a dynamic stage and push the puck towards opposing goals, either by boosting into it or by ‚Äúriding‚Äù it ‚Äì players can hop onto slow-moving pucks, move them, then shoot them in any direction.
<br><br>
Each stage is a mish-mash of hazards: spinning fans, gates that open and close, booster pads, moving walls, and more. Scoring enough goals wins the stage, and winning a stage adds a layer of color to the winner‚Äôs screen print. Each match consists of a handful of stages pulled from a large pool, lasting until one team has won enough stages to complete their poster art!
<br><br>
Dyebreaker is a work-in-progress and this prototype focuses on gameplay. The final game will feature many playable teams, each with their own unique characters and poster art.
<br><br>
Dyebreaker is designed and developed by Walt Mitchell, who also draws some of the pixel art. Walt is a webdev-turned-gamedev who made a handful of arcade games and now works in the games industry professionally, mostly on game UI. Walt is assisted by his childhood friend, Ramsey Haefner, an L.A.-based animator and illustrator who has been developing Dyebreaker's color palettes, UI design, and pixel art.

                <h4>Warline</h4>
<p>Warline is a fantasy strategy and tactics board game in which you design a unique strategy interactively, then design complex custom combos with your units on the battlefield. The game is set against an "elegant dark fantasy" backdrop; you take on the role of one of Soroyland's four warring kingdoms, each populated by new, non-standard fantasy races. Three unique game modes offer flexible player counts (1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-players) and invite you into the history of Warline's world.
<br><br>
Warline has been likened to, "Final Fantasy Tactics if you could design your own tactical actions with each turn."

                <h4>Welcome to Polly‚Äôs Place</h4>
<p>Welcome to Polly's Place is an interactive fiction meant to bring about the nostalgia of early 2000's internet culture. From taking care of digital pets to getting harassed on fan forums this time period was unique in the strangest way. We were just figuring out that the internet could be used to connect more people than ever before. These connections are the focus of this project. The friendships that weren't possible before the fear of the millennium bug. The people we talked to daily on game sites that have now become inactive. People who are just as real to us as we are to them. Even if you can't speak to someone face to face, your connection to them is still worthwhile. Polly's Place aims to blur the line between an "internet friend" and a "real friend" if not erase it completely.
