                <h4>Teddy's Inferno</h4>
                <p>Teddy's Inferno is a top-down arcade shooter with Asteroids-style movement, heavily inspired by Devil Daggers. The player has to survive as long as possible against increasingly frantic waves of enemies, collecting gems to upgrade their weapon in the process. The player's score is purely based on how long they survive. Several special game modes are also available, which alter the difficulty or change the rules of the game. It's named after my cat, Teddy (though the game has nothing to do with cats).
				The game is complete and out (for free) on itch.io, and I built it solo (using a few free assets) with the Phaser 3 game engine.

				Robocrow is a hobbyist game developer, working solo on small, free browser games in their spare time, and has been building games on and off since high school. Robocrow likes to build games that are simple and quick to play, but offer a lot of replayability.
