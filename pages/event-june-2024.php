                <h4>1-1(bit)</h4>
                <p>Dying is Feedback. Death is information. 1-1(bit) is a puzzle platformer made in Pulp for the Playdate. The platforms are invisible and the player builds a mental map of the level layout through traversal and observation... but is there more to the game than a grid of dots? You must be dreaming.
				<br>
					Players Can reveal the level using the B menu. Players also tend Not to do that. 
				<br><br>
				Inspiration This game was inspired by a similar project shown at Fantastic Arcade. It was a beautiful wooden arcade wall mount that consisted of a joystick and a single, vertical strip of red LEDs. As you navigated the level you 'viewed' it 1-pixel slice at a time by observing your dot's position.
				<br><br>
				Ledbetter Games has been making and showing Playdate games in Austin, Tx for the last couple years. They created the ART series, CHEK for 2-4 players and are very much looking forward to seeing you play 1-1(bit) Off-Planet Dreams and perhaps creating a level or two of your own!

                <p>In Comic Book Boom!, you play as a comics publisher at the height of the industryâ€™s wildest era: The bombastic 1990â€™s. To score big in this booming market, youâ€™ll need to...
				<br><br>
					â€¢ Publish books with the hottest â€™90s themes
					<br>
					â€¢ Hype up readers with outrageous stunts
					<br>
					â€¢ Dazzle collectors with enhanced cover gimmicks
				<br><br>
					Be careful: Push the fans too far, and this boom is going to bust. Through big bets and market manipulation, you and your rival publishers might print up a fortune â€“ or get too greedy and lose it all!

                <p>Lisa Hutâ€™s Memory Palace is a digital scrapbook of weirdly specific pop culture moments. Inspired by the intensity of Y2K era fan sites and tween notebook collages, Lisa Hut created over a dozen web shrines to pop culture memories collected through an anonymous online survey. The pages are layered with cable TV screen grabs, glitter text, and archival GeoCities GIFs re-creating each moment, hyper-personalized with the context the memory-sharers included like where they were or who their celebrity crush was at the time. Visit Lisa Hutâ€™s Memory Palace to dig into the media moments that just wonâ€™t leave peopleâ€™s heads.
                <br><br>
                Lisa Hut is a hastily thrown together collective of two lil' freaks living in Austin, TX. They make digital art about hyper-specific pop culture moments in an unsuccessful-yet-cute attempt to connect with people around them.

                <h4>Power Creeps</h4>
                <p>Power Creeps is a simple and chaotic TTRPG system that blends dice mechanics with party-game style rules. It is played with 2-6 players and 1 Creep Master (CM.) Players cast spells from an ever changing collection of words created by the group at the start of the game. The players work together as a party to pursue and acquire their one true Desire.
