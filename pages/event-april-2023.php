                <h4>Astra and the New Constellation</h4>
<p>Astra And The New Constellation is a retro-inspired mascot platformer, developed entirely in the Pico-8 fantasy console engine. Play as the titular starlet Astra as she journeys across the galaxy, collecting stardust to form a constellation of her own to call home. AATNC features 15 distinct levels, nearly 30 minutes of original music, and a variety of options and accessibility features to support players in making the experience fit their preferences and needs.
<br><br>
Created by hobbyist developer Travis "rarelikeaunicorn" Antosh as a passion project over the course of three years, AATNC is their first commercial release and an attempt to showcase the power of Pico-8 in spite of its significant constraints while also harkening back to the games they played (and the ones they didn't get to play!) in their own childhood during the 90s.

                <p>Approaching the 20th anniversary of evastars' "pixel friends" series, the original members of evastars have partnered with the Welcome to my Homepage and digital preservationist Rachel Simone Weil of FEMICOM Museum to produce pfft: an evastars retrospective. This retrospective project includes an official remaster of selected works from the pixel friends series, interviews, an illustrated glossary full of y2k web history, plus throw-back merch. Join us in celebration of this influential all-girl net art collective!
				<br><br>
				Rachel Simone Weil combines approaches from electrical engineering, art history, and DIY culture to create video art and electronic objects that reimagine the history of technology. She has produced glitch art and interactive works for formats ranging from payphones to browsers to 1980s video game consoles to handmade textiles. Weil's work is united by playful subversion of historical narratives, often through the creation of fakes and forgeries, to imagine a whimsical playground of electronic artifacts from an imagined past that privileges diverse participation over commercial viability. She has performed, shown work, or curated shows for museums and small DIY shows alike, including Blip Festival (New York), the V&A Museum (London), Glitch Festival (Chicago), and the Living Computer Museum (Seattle). Weil is also the founder of FEMICOM Museum.

                <h4>A Forthcoming Archive of Lost Art</h4>
<p>
Josh Kery revisits the occurrence of a theft as an occasion to reflect on art making, record collecting, and preservation with his dad, Peter Kery. Fraudulent movers stole most of Peter‚Äôs possessions during a cross country move in 2021.‚Äã Among the things not stolen are his complete vinyl collection and a portion of his photographic portfolio from the 90s. 
During his residency, Josh created a web archive of audio of stories recorded during a series of interviews paired with B sides of original prints by Peter and A sides of new images by Josh. Album explores objects as memory triggers, and archiving as a way of accepting loss.

Josh Kery is a multidisciplinary artist making work about passing down stories and possessions between family members.

Kery has shown work at the Philadelphia Fringe Festival, the Pennsylvania Center for Women in Politics, and the Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry. In 2020, he earned a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and moved to Washington DC in 2022.
