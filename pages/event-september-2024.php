                <h4>Dance Machine 2000</h4>
                <p>The Dance Machine 2000 is a jukebox-inspired vessel that serves up dance videos that are as playful, absurdist, and unpolished as the currencies you can offer it. Will you choose to give the machine a round of applause or dense fog? What sort of dance will it inspire? 
				<br><br>
				Tay Hall spent their residency month considering alternative economies, ways of connecting with dance without the stakes of live performance, and exploring movement for camera. Like an old machine, they encountered some rusty parts while returning to a practice of video editing and collaboration. The resulting collection of videos and interactions are satisfyingly groovy, improvisational, and thoughtful.
