                    Florian and Baptiste started working together when they were studying graphic design and illustration. They both had a deep interest in storytelling and interactivity. After having spent time at various companies and other game related freelance missions, they join up to get back to what got them talking in the first place: making beautiful, emotional and entertaining games for everyone.
