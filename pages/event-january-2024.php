                <h4>HouseKeeping</h4>
                <p>HouseKeeping is an Isometric Couch Co-Op party game similar to Overcooked or Splatoon. Two teams of players must battle for control of the House. The Keepers (House Cleaners) must clean the house. While the Cats must destroy the house and of course cause chaos. Whoever has more control of the house at the end of the round wins. We hope to take this game further and hopefully publish it at some point!
                <br><br>
               HouseKeeping was developed by a small team of students at Austin Community College as our final project in college. We as a team enjoyed developing this game so much we recently submitted it to the Independent Games Festival. In hopes of being nominated for "Best Student Game".

<p>"You're on a path in the woods. And at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess (Nichole Goodnight).
<br><br>
You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will mean the end of the world. 

At least, that's what The Narrator (Jonathan Sims) tells you. But can you trust him? Can you trust her? Sure, you can do as you're told, killing the entity in the basement, whether she's a Princess or... something else. Or you can try to find some other way out of the eternity of choices and twisting paths youand the ""Princess"" have found yourselves in.

After all... is the world that tasked you to save it really worth saving?"
