                        "At the Edge of Everything is a two-player meditative roleplaying game which explores how memory shapes identity and relationship through collaborative watercolor painting and storytelling. Players collaboratively watercolor and share memories, dynamically creating characters and relationships by exploring how memories are formed and how they fade away. These memories need not be your own, but can be if you wish. Stretch the limits of reality and fiction, unraveling the strands of time as you tell you and your characters‚Äô shared story.
                        <br><br>
                        At the Edge of Everything is a game about creation, growth and decay, and the beauty of the cycle between them. Fading memories give way to vibrant canvases for new events. How will you remember your life?"

In addition to game development, I am a sound designer, a video editor, media artist, and maker space logistics coordinator.

                       Frog Joust is a physical poker-like card game where you challenge fellow players into contests of might! Players use cards in their hands as champions to compete against each other and gamble coins in a quest to be the wealthiest lord! Each champion has an associated strength value, with the larger number winning the contest, but worry not, as losing gains you a card from the retribution deck, potentially giving you an edge in your following contests. Push your luck or bluff your way to victory!
