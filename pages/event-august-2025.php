                        <p>
                        "How To Make It Home is a text game in which the player navigates an urban landscape at night. It‚Äôs about alienation, cities, wildlife, and helplessness. The world is dark and you are a misanthropic type, not fully human, beast, or spirit but some amalgam of them all, seeking to carve out a home in a place that feels unfamiliar. Your decisions illuminate your path, as you traverse the grease and heat of the city‚Äôs intestines, writhe in the grass, hiss at glaring streetlights, and wonder at mysterious creatures. Take a journey or two and see what you become. The night is calling, time to go.
                        <br><br>
                        Perfect for fans of poetry, interactive fiction, nighttime walks, idly picking at scabs, or coding with Javascript frameworks. This project was made using Undum."

                        <p>
                        I AM NOT A ROBOT is an interactive fiction about an online bot grasping for a deeper understanding of humanity through its favorite communication formats - captchas and personality quizzes. The user is prompted through a conversation about love, bodies, and identity, culminating in a poetic interpretation of the provided responses. Inspired by research into AI assistants and companion bot users, Taylor Paydos‚Äôs hand coded project asks us to playfully introspect on our relationships to AI. Do we see them as gendered, intimate, soulless? What does it mean to tell a computer that you‚Äôre human?

                        Hello, Morgan here! Tin and I made this as part of an advanced VR game development course over the course of ten weeks. I was the level designer and artist and Tin made all the sounds for the game. I've always been very interested in walking simulators ever since I played my three favorites a couple years back, those being Cement Mixer Simulator 2003, Hendecad, and Red Desert Render, which you can find on itch!
