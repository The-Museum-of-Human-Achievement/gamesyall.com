                <h4>1-1(bit)</h4>
                <p>Dying is Feedback. Death is information. 1-1(bit) is a puzzle platformer made in Pulp for the Playdate. The platforms are invisible and the player builds a mental map of the level layout through traversal and observation... but is there more to the game than a grid of dots? You must be dreaming.
				<br>
					Players Can reveal the level using the B menu. Players also tend Not to do that. 
				<br><br>
				Inspiration This game was inspired by a similar project shown at Fantastic Arcade. It was a beautiful wooden arcade wall mount that consisted of a joystick and a single, vertical strip of red LEDs. As you navigated the level you 'viewed' it 1-pixel slice at a time by observing your dot's position.
				<br><br>
				Ledbetter Games has been making and showing Playdate games in Austin, Tx for the last couple years. They created the ART series, CHEK for 2-4 players and are very much looking forward to seeing you play 1-1(bit) Off-Planet Dreams and perhaps creating a level or two of your own!
