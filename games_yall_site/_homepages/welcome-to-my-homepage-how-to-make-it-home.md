description: 'How To Make It Home is a text game in which the player navigates an
  urban landscape at night. It’s about alienation, cities, wildlife, and helplessness.
  The world is dark and you are a misanthropic type, not fully human, beast, or spirit
  but some amalgam of them all, seeking to carve out a home in a place that feels
  unfamiliar. Your decisions illuminate your path, as you traverse the grease and
  heat of the city’s intestines, writhe in the grass, hiss at glaring streetlights,
  and wonder at mysterious creatures. Take a journey or two and see what you become.
  The night is calling, time to go.


  Perfect for fans of poetry, interactive fiction, nighttime walks, idly picking at
  scabs, or coding with Javascript frameworks. This project was made using Undum.'
