“I find flowers beautiful. The work of French Modernists as well. But, the aesthetic pleasure I experience with both is tinged with an undercurrent of unease. To me, they will always be haunted by the image of the Asian woman as ‘Lotus Blossom.’”—Kaitlin Hsu

Plans for a Garden is a series of web poems located within a map of Claude Monet’s Giverny garden. The work addresses a trope in Western art to stereotype Asian women as delicate and decorative by representing them as inanimate objects such as flowers. Curious to disentangle her aesthetic love of flowers from these harmful connotations, Kaitlin Hsu cultivates her thoughts in a variety of formats. The webpages include concrete poetry, a collection of animated gifs, a prompt for embodiment, and an interactive desktop. Traverse the garden and see where your mind wanders.

Perfect for fans of experimental poetry formats, approachable film theory, Asian cultural studies, art history, and feminism—as well as for those who feel conflicted about something they love.
