description: I AM NOT A ROBOT is an interactive fiction about an online bot grasping
  for a deeper understanding of humanity through its favorite communication formats
  - captchas and personality quizzes. The user is prompted through a conversation
  about love, bodies, and identity, culminating in a poetic interpretation of the
  provided responses. Inspired by research into AI assistants and companion bot users,
  Taylor Paydos’s hand coded project asks us to playfully introspect on our relationships
  to AI. Do we see them as gendered, intimate, soulless? What does it mean to tell
  a computer that you’re human?
