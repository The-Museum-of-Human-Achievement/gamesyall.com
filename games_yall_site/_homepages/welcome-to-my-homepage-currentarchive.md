description: currentarchive is a poetic net art project that reflects my research
  process as a mixed, diasporic anishinaabe. It animates the senses of obscurity,
  denial, and loss that often define searches for indigeneity in institutional spaces
  (and sometimes daily life). i altered photographic, audio, and textual material
  from my own experience and family history to subvert the oppressive practices of
  redaction and obfuscation. currentarchive is entwined with refusal—first to be recognized,
  and then to be dismissed.
