The ምርቃት (mirik’at) / blessings generator is a collaborative web-based interactive work by Betelhem Makonnen, Mayet, and Mihret Kebede. Inspired by coffee ceremonies and the verbal art of well-wishing from their shared homeland of Ethiopia, the artists created this project to cultivate a new practice of collective care-taking for virtual space.

The website allows visitors to receive blessings on topics ranging from world woes to future hopes, or to receive a customized blessing based on their specific concern. Sharing a wealth of knowledge about the practice of well-wishing, the project invites visitors to bring ምርቃት (mirik’at) into their lives to experience the sense of wellbeing and interconnectedness that come with rooting for each other and honoring interdependence.
