description: 'a side view of a yellow car, is a tiny artistic web project I started
  in the context of the Welcome to My Homepage Residency. The aim is to experiment
  and toy with accessibility features such as alt text, audio transcription, but also
  low-tech media loaders designed for people with low-connectivity internet. The result
  is this intimate one-page website that features pictures of yellow cars alongside
  personal reflections on digital imagery in the age of self-driving cars. The website
  implements multiple accessibility features: an image loader that displays pixelated
  images by default with an added grainy aesthetic, a contextualized audio transcription
  of the page, and alt text for all images written in 5-7-5 short poem format.'
developer: Kaspar Ravel
developer_bio: Kaspar Ravel (they/them) is an artist, teacher, and researcher in tactical
  new media. Their work draws from a tradition of art movements set in between symbolic
  activism and practical approaches (from subtle gestures to concrete actions). As
  a self-taught coder and DIY hacker, their intention is to demystify technology,
  which brings them to encourage low-tech cultures and digital literacy in educational
  contexts, such as workshops, tutorials and micro-edition. Today, they aspire to
  develop discursive and programmatic tools for resistance against the veil of big
  data and globalised surveillance. Their research takes the form of 'poelitical'
  experiments, merging poetic expression with political critique within on/offline
  artworks.
