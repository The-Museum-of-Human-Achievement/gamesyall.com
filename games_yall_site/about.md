## About Us
*Games Y'all* is a meetup presented by the Museum of Human Achievement, held every month at venues around Austin for indie devs, digital artists, and games fans. Games Y'all celebrates, amplifies, and supports the unique and underrepresented within indie games and beyond. Come play games, share what you're working on, hang out and meet friends.

### Join the Committee!
We are always seeking new voices to shape the future of Games Y'all.
We strive for strong representation of BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, female, gender nonbinary, and disabled individuals in our leadership to best serve our diverse community. Folks of identities that are underrepresented in the games industry are especially encouraged to apply (whether you work in the industry or not).
