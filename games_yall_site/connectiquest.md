# ConnectiQuest

#### ConnectiQuest was held September 20th, 2024 - 7-10pm at [The Museum of Human Achievement](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WWRbD2tmVacS79YH6)

ConnectiQuest was a way to meet new folks, play new games, and earn cool swag. There were 6 playbooks to complete, each with different themes and objectives.

For details about attending orgs, games shown, and swag donors see the [September 2024 Games Y'all page](/events/event-september-2024/)!

ConnectiQuest is a LARP based heavily on the incredible [Big Bad World](https://www.bigbadcon.com/blog/big-bad-world/).

A PDF of the playbooks can be found here: [on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgxAoSRpnSriiXoHioVtB-OXg4djOfhU/view?usp=sharing).

The layout used to make these cards can be found on [Dextrous](https://www.dextrous.com.au/layouts/shared/JFKByVHuOsMbNTEZO8AeKUFMmJU2/sOApq6hbwVjUb5p0YRxn).

The playbooks are all below - the data from these is being pulled from this [Google Docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0uecFSYUsVOOFncs_mWSXvMRzwkKJt4tBupt7AaAGQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

![How to Play - Get a playbook, head to the Quest Desk to pick up a playbook that sounds interesting! Different playbooks contain different types of objectives, the 'Basic Moves' are shared between most playbooks. Turn in playbook - Once you have marked all the XP slots on a playbook head back to the Quest Desk to turn it in and grab a piece of swag. Complete objectives - Review your playbook to determine how to 'Mark XP' ConnectiQuest is a grade your own homework type of event. As you complete objectives mark off experience on your track. Repeat - Pick a new playbook that you haven't completed yet and get to work.](/images/misc-img/connectiquest-how-to-play.png)
