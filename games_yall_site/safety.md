The hotline and reporting form are reviewed regularly but are not intended to be rapid response resources


### Community Guidleines
**We want you to feel safe and to be safe at our events.** The most important thing we want you to know is that if something or someone makes you feel uncomfortable at one of our events, no matter how minor it seems, you can report it to us.


#### Harassment Policy
Harassment of event participants, staff or volunteers at Games Y'all events will not be tolerated. Anyone violating this policy may be expelled from this and future events.


Harassment includes offensive verbal comments or attitudes related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurodivergence, physical appearance, race, religion; deliberate intimidation, stalking, non-consensual photography or recording, sustained disruption of the event, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. We prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.


#### No Excuses
Neither ignorance nor intoxication are an excuse for harassment. Games Y'all also accepts that we are not above our own policies so please know all of the above applies to all members of our team in equal measure.


#### Build Respect
We are dedicated to providing an inclusive environment for all. Let’s create a respectful and positive space together!
