[Submission Form](https://form.jotform.com/231816434607153)  
  
Show us your stuff y’all! New or old, finished or beta, game or not-quite game; if it's playable, we want to see it!

## How This Works

Our mission is to celebrate, amplify, and support unique games and underrepresented groups within indie games and beyond. This form and our selection process are an extension of our mission. We are specifically looking to uplift smaller teams, smaller games, and projects that don't quite fit the "games" mold. Your project doesn't even need to be finished! As long as your game is playable, we'd like to see it!  
  
We use the words game and project interchangeably in this form but, if selected, we will be in contact to ask which term you prefer for your project! Things that aren't necessarily games like net art, interactive media and experimental controllers are also accepted.  
  
If you have a project that doesn't fit the form, please email us at <info@gamesyall.com>.  
  
Applications are reviewed by the selection committee on a rolling basis and don't expire. If accepted, we'll reach out to discuss schedule and logistics. Every month we will post a deadline to be featured for our next roundup, but don’t fret! Games that do not get selected will be considered for future meetups.  
  
Games Y'all is not interested in exhibiting any game or tool that uses or features AI Generated assets, including images, audio, or text. For the purposes of this ban, 'AI Generated' refers to any deep-learning model that 'learns' from raw data to generate statistically probable outputs. Submissions that are found to make use of these tools without disclosing it will be subject to immediate removal and potentially a ban from further exhibition.
