bio: "Franco relocated from Richmond, Virginia to Austin in late 2023 with a goal of making games. Joining the committee at the end of 2024, he wants to help make sure the community has a place to meet up and talk about games. Graduating from ACCâ€™s game design program, Franco works on project after project learning the ropes of game making. When not working, he explores Austin - drawing the people, places and things he comes across."
