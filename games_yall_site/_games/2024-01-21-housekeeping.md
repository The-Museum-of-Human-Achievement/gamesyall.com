description: HouseKeeping is an Isometric Couch Co-Op party game similar to Overcooked
  or Splatoon. Two teams of players must battle for control of the House. The Keepers
  (House Cleaners) must clean the house. While the Cats must destroy the house and
  of course cause chaos. Whoever has more control of the house at the end of the round
  wins. We hope to take this game further and hopefully publish it at some point!
developer: ' Team HouseKeeping'
developer_bio: HouseKeeping was developed by a small team of students at Austin Community
  College as our final project in college. We as a team enjoyed developing this game
  so much we recently submitted it to the Independent Games Festival. In hopes of
  being nominated for \"Best Student Game\".
