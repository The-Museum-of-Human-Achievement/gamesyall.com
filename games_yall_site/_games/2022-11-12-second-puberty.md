developer_bio: 'Hi, I''m D. Squinkifer, queer game designer and regular ordinary human,
  and this is where I live on the internet.


  I''m one of the cofounders of Soft Chaos, a worker-owned cooperative that creates
  critically-engaged, intimate, vulnerable, and unique interactive experiences. Our
  work includes experimental videogames, tabletop games, larps, art installations,
  and interactive performances.


  You can also check out my solo projects on itch.io, the most recent of which is
  a videogame album called Squinky and the Squinkettes present: SECOND PUBERTY.


  I''ve developed a healthy disdain for social media over the years, so should you
  wish to communicate with me, email is probably best.'
