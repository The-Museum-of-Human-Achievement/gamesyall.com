description: ' In her Welcome to my Homepage projects, Elexus Pettigrew scratches
  at her relationship to Christianity and reflects on growing up as a closeted, Black,
  daughter of a preacher. When making the collage This Is America, she questioned
  if Black church is becoming more modern or returning to stereotypes of what Black
  congregants are supposed to be. For the video Bible Study, Pettigrew turned against
  her programming to not deface the bible, and instead followed a childhood urge to
  express herself on the pages. '

developer_bio: Elexus Pettigrew is an African-American artist who uses video and photos
  to speak about our relationship with media consumption. Her main focus of work plays
  on being a product of your environment and how media consumption and programming
  make us who we are today. In her work, she uses stacked videos that show a representation
  of black stereotypes, and relationships we build through biased medias. In addition,
  a meditated communication of conversation can be followed along with each piece.
