description: "Solar War! A fast-paced, space-themed, shoot-em-up, bullet hell, arcade style game where players attempt to shoot and weave through a horde of enemy planets in a bid to survive just a little bit longer.<br><br>The planets have orbited peacefully for countless millennia. But then… BOOM! Now all orbital bodies are free to move independent of gravity (and they can respawn when defeated too.) You're The Earth… good luck!"
