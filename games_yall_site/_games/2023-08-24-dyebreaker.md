description: 'Dyebreaker is a two-button “air hockey platformer” with visuals inspired
  by screen print posters and the Game Boy Color. Two teams jump around a dynamic
  stage and push the puck towards opposing goals, either by boosting into it or by
  “riding” it – players can hop onto slow-moving pucks, move them, then shoot them
  in any direction.


  Each stage is a mish-mash of hazards: spinning fans, gates that open and close,
  booster pads, moving walls, and more. Scoring enough goals wins the stage, and winning
  a stage adds a layer of color to the winner’s screen print. Each match consists
  of a handful of stages pulled from a large pool, lasting until one team has won
  enough stages to complete their poster art!


  Dyebreaker is a work-in-progress and this prototype focuses on gameplay. The final
  game will feature many playable teams, each with their own unique characters and
  poster art.'
