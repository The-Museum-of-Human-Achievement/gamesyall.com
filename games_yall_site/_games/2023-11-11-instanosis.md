developer: ' Oddalys Salcido'
developer_bio: "Oddalys Salcido is a 1st generation latine queer movement artist and\
  \ filmmaker from Austin, Texas. As a child they felt cosmically connected to Selena\
  \ Quintanilla and has been searching for that feeling in everything they\u2019ve\
  \ done since. Traditionally trained as a choreographer, contemporary dancer and\
  \ reality TV consumer, Oddalys is a movement inspired filmmaker. With influences\
  \ of absurdity and tenderness they bring an observant collage of their identities,\
  \ mental illness and humorous existentialism embedded in both their films, choreography,\
  \ and instagram captions. They morph into many identities such as a professional\
  \ dancer for ARCOS, co-founder/director of Preheat Film Festival, web designer for\
  \ artists, filmmaker, digital composer, tote bag designer, and cyborg. They are\
  \ passionate about experimenting with contemporary movement and technology as a\
  \ tool to blend both existing and non existing borders."
