They meet Vox, who offers to guide them in the exploration of this world until they regain their memory. When Inanis finally regains their memory, Vox reveals that they are dead. After meeting with "god", Inanis must decide whether to stay in that world or return to life.<br><br> Afterdeath is my graduation film for Universidad San Francisco de Quito where I got my B.A. in Computer Animation.
