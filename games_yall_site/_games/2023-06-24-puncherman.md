PUNCHING IS ALL YOU KNOW. YOU'VE PUNCHED ALIENS, DEMONS, ZOMBIES—BUT WITH THESE THREATS GONE, YOU FACE YOUR GREATEST CHALLENGE YET: FAMILY LIFE.

PUNCHERMAN! is a comedy physics dad simulator where you live a day in the life of a former violent FPS protagonist/superhero/generally manly man as he tries to prove himself as a good father and husband. But there’s one problem with that: the only real ability he has is an insanely powerful PUNCH!

Engage in the most masculine of stay-at-home-daddery by completing household chores and running errands using only your fists of fury… and accidentally destroy everything you see in the process.
