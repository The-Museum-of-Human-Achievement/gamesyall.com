description: 'Iâ€™ll be showing two of my paintings reimagined inside Unity as interactive
  worlds. Maya Reimagined takes inspiration from Mayan culture and transforms it into
  a colorful, surreal 3D space you can explore. Let Them Stay turns one of my canvas
  works into a living digital painting, with shifting colors and movement that play
  with the idea of home and belonging. Both projects are about taking my art off the
  wall and letting people step inside the art and story itself. '
