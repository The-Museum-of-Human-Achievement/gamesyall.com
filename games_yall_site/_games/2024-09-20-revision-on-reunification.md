description: Jo Suk's Revision on Reunification is a digital memorial for the Arch
  of Reunification, which stood in Pyongyang, North Korea from 2001 to 2024. Its intentional
  demolition by the North Korean government confirmed a new era for South-North relations
  on the Korean peninsula, characterized by open antagonism. This inflection point
  follows decades of failed efforts at peaceful reunification, incurred in part by
  U.S. interventionism. Though now nonexistent, the Arch of Reunification continues
  with a new nature through this digital memorial, one that personalizes, politicizes,
  and questions the posthumous symbolism of the monument.
