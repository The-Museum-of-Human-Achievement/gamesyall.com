description: This is a simple prototype for an alternate way of typing using a gamepad
  without using an on-screen keyboard. It's designed similar to a radial menu, with
  the four primary buttons (ABXY) each housing a different menu containing 8 letters.
  The user selects the letter they wish to type from the menu using the joystick.
  ControllerType is an alternative, faster way of typing using a gamepad that avoids
  an onscreen keyboard, instead opting to use a radial menu.  While this is mainly
  just a prototype, there are a variety of options included to help make this method
  of typing as approachable as possible (as well as a few other surprises hidden inside).
