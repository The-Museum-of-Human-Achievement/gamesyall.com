developer_bio: 'Bridgebourn is a solo passion video game project currently being developed
  by me, Bamboo Bandit (Siavash Ranjbar) since 2016. My love of travel, nature and
  childhood gaming experiences inspired me to create something that can bring that
  same joy to others. I practiced illustration throughout my youth and picked up programming
  in grade-school to fulfill this dream. The time has finally come to make this project
  a reality.
