developer_bio: Merge Conflict Studio is an ATX based, indie game studio co-founded
  by 6 passionate developers who met at UT Austin. At Merge Conflict, we strive to
  make games that center on environmental awareness and marginalized perspectives,
  and we do not use generative AI in any capacity. We released our first game \"Re:Fresh\"
  in 2023 and have just released the demo for our second game \"Gemporium\" this year.
