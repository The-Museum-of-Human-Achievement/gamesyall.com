description: 'At the Edge of Everything is a two-player meditative roleplaying game
  which explores how memory shapes identity and relationship through collaborative
  watercolor painting and storytelling. Players collaboratively watercolor and share
  memories, dynamically creating characters and relationships by exploring how memories
  are formed and how they fade away. These memories need not be your own, but can
  be if you wish. Stretch the limits of reality and fiction, unraveling the strands
  of time as you tell you and your characters’ shared story.


  At the Edge of Everything is a game about creation, growth and decay, and the beauty
  of the cycle between them. Fading memories give way to vibrant canvases for new
  events. How will you remember your life?'
