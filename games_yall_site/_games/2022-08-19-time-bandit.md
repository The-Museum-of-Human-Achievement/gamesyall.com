 Time Bandit is an idle adventure game where everything you do takes time. By coming back to the game periodically, you are invited to make as much or as little progress as you like, to make playing it a kind of habit or meaningful ritual, to welcome addictive gameplay loops or explore how to break them. It tells a story of how our time doesn’t belong to us — and how we can take it back.
