description: Nightingale is a short form horror game with some light puzzle elements
  developed for the Playdate. (Entirely in pulp!) It's about what it means to feel
  safe in your own body, inspired mostly by my experiences with auto-immune conditions.
  Expected release September 2023. CW for mild blood, R-rated language, and implied
  child abuse/neglect.
