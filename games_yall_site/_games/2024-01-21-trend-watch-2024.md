Make your own Trend Watch 2024 workbook as you explore trend predictions, dig into your memories and your purse to find lifestyle inspiration, and upload your assignments to be graded by Julia Kunze herself (don’t worry, I hear she’s an easy grader). Julia’s mixed media aesthetic and background as an educator make for an incredibly playful, exploratory, and creative experience.

MTVs catfish, superhero costumes, fantasy romance novels, country music and anything low-rent help Julia Kunze make sculptures and drawings. She has had many fashion shows and knows a lot about trends. Her favorite line is the one between funny and serious and that is what she hopes to achieve in her work.
