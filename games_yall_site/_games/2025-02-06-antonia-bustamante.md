description: During her Welcome to my Homepage residency, Antonia Bustamante collected
  websites that inspire her, ranging from net art, poetry, and tools, to archives,
  newsletters, and community resources. They are arranged as a series of unmarked
  doors, allowing for chance explorations, countering the algorithmically determined
  pathways of social media feeds and search engines. A sidebar also provides an indexed
  list of the links, for quick scanning and intentional browsing. Heading the page
  are poetic questions and concepts, in Spanish and English, that guide the curation
  of the project and invite you to ponder the gesture of a website that leads you
  outside of itself. The project beckons you to wander its halls, or hop to a destination
  from the directory - each bringing a small joy and a new destination on Antonia’s
  personal map of the web.
