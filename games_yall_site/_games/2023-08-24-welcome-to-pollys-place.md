description: Welcome to Polly's Place is an interactive fiction meant to bring about
  the nostalgia of early 2000's internet culture. From taking care of digital pets
  to getting harassed on fan forums this time period was unique in the strangest way.
  We were just figuring out that the internet could be used to connect more people
  than ever before. These connections are the focus of this project. The friendships
  that weren't possible before the fear of the millennium bug. The people we talked
  to daily on game sites that have now become inactive. People who are just as real
  to us as we are to them. Even if you can't speak to someone face to face, your connection
  to them is still worthwhile. Polly's Place aims to blur the line between an \"internet
  friend\" and a \"real friend\" if not erase it completely.
