developer: ' Rachel Weil'
developer_bio: Rachel Simone Weil combines approaches from electrical engineering,
  art history, and DIY culture to create video art and electronic objects that reimagine
  the history of technology. She has produced glitch art and interactive works for
  formats ranging from payphones to browsers to 1980s video game consoles to handmade
  textiles. Weil's work is united by playful subversion of historical narratives,
  often through the creation of fakes and forgeries, to imagine a whimsical playground
  of electronic artifacts from an imagined past that privileges diverse participation
  over commercial viability. She has performed, shown work, or curated shows for museums
  and small DIY shows alike, including Blip Festival (New York), the V&A Museum (London),
  Glitch Festival (Chicago), and the Living Computer Museum (Seattle). Weil is also
  the founder of FEMICOM Museum.
