description: Chek is a 2 or 4-player pass'n play board game that is also available
  for the Playdate! The game is designed to sit between checkers and chess in terms
  of strategy - quite simple to learn but deep in interaction. A game of Chek often
  swings between careful movement of groups of allied pieces, followed by a bloodbath
  of combat.
