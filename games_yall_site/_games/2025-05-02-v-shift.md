developer_bio: Founded in 2024, Propel Studios began as a team of seven passionate
  UT Austin students, creating V-Shift as their senior capstone project. Fueled by
  their own dedication, they continued to work on V-Shift post-school, publishing
  the game on Steam and showcasing at GDC Play 2025. Embracing the chaos of creativity
  as a tool to improve, Propel Studios push themselves to design games that are as
  engaging to play as they are exciting to master, bringing friends and rivals together
  in unforgettable battles.
