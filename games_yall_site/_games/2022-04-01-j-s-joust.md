description: J.S.Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed
  for motion controllers. The goal is to be the last player remaining. When the music
  - J.S. Bach's Brandenburg Concertos - plays in slow-motion, the controllers are
  very sensitive to movement. When the music speeds up, the threshold becomes less
  strict, giving the players a small window to dash at their opponents.
