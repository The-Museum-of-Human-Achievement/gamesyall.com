For her residency project, Laura M. Cañas P. envisions a poetic economy that centers symbolic creation of art and nature over material capitalism. Classifieds for Poets is a radically tender job board for sensitive creatives, with illustrations inspired by medieval prints. The listings reflect an understanding of the economy as a complex system that regulates resources such as ideas, vital energy, and emotions. The site also features oracle cards, prompting reflections on creative life. Step into the reality Laura has created and consider: “Economy is a fiction. How would you tell the story?”
