description: Forge an explosive arsenal in NIMRODS, the reverse bullet hell roguelite
  that combines gun crafting and survivor action. Blast through waves of deadly aliens
  and unlock new characters. Craft powerful weapons on your mission and research them
  to develop new tech and become the ultimate space hunter! NIMRODS distinguishes
  itself by enhancing the foundation of survive-em-up games, presenting a profound
  adventure marked by substantive exploration within a profoundly engaging meta game
  centered around innovative gun crafting. The concept of gun crafting isn't simply
  about assembling conventional weapons, but rather conjuring an assortment of unconventional
  and whimsical armaments. Fancy a pistol equipped with a sniper scope? You got it.
  How about an assault rifle that launches homing projectiles, which then divide and
  detonate upon impact? Absolutely. Perhaps even a shotgun sporting an AK magazine
  cleverly camouflaged as a banana? You bet.
