description: ' Imagine you''re the most popular kid in school. So popular, in fact,
  that you''re dating every single person in your class. The only problem? You''ve
  decided to break up with all of them, one by one. HEARTBREAK HIGH is an arcade-style
  spin on visual novels and dating simulators that asks you to break up with all of
  your high school sweethearts instead of woo them. A single play-through can be completed
  in one 20-40 minute sitting, with each break-up featuring a unique branching story
  path and lovable (or unlovable?) characters for you to crush beneath your feet over
  and over again.'
