description: Prometheus Unbound is a 2D stealth platformer with graceful speed and
  machine-precision movement. The player controls Anala Piers, a cyborg-corpse laborer
  under the control of CarpoTech. Anala regains consciousness and immediately seeks
  answers and revenge for what happened to her. Gameplay includes fast-paced parkour
  movement and jumps, as well as stealth mechanics like sneaking, hiding, and wall
  sticking. Each stage is timed, allowing players to re-attempt levels for faster
  times, or even to challenge the clear times the developers set! In addition to the
  main story levels, there are five challenge levels where players can test their
  platforming and parkouring abilities to the limits. In addition, many levels are
  open to explore in multiple ways, allowing the player to find hidden collectibles
  and other areas. Following its release in March, Prometheus Unbound made the longlist
  for the 2024 Yugo BAFTA Student Awards.
