description: 'Pollinate the meadow! Dodge the Duck! Go on an adventure with Zoop Zoop
  and his friends, to save his meadows from the dastardly Dick Dastardly Duck! Compete
  with your friends to collect the most yummy pollins!


  A game made in Wasm4, a fantasy console without all the bells and whistles. Wasm4
  supports many compiled languages, my favorite being Zig. There are merely 15 functions
  and 64kb to use, cartridges come with rollback multiplayer and save states built
  in.


  Wasm4 makes low-level and new programmers feel at home, use your own text editor,
  language of choice, and sprites can even be drawn in binary!'
