description: i feel so much shame is a browser-based interactive narrative made from
  scanned Risograph prints. Inspired by Risograph animation techniques, it offers
  a meditation on shame and desire as told through interactive and animated buttons,
  hyperlinks, inputs, and background gradients made embodied and material, with each
  and every moment of the website existing in printed form. Through a laborious process
  of printing, scanning, and realigning over 700 images and making them interactive
  with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the making of the piece–in all of its effort, repetition,
  and imperfections–also becomes one of its core realizations.
