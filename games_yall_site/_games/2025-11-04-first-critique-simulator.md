  the morning working through your nerves, talking to friends, and prepping to present
  as you make your way through the halls to class. As you discuss your project, respond
  to critiques from students and professors to the best of your ability without taking
  it personally. See how your decisions and reactions effect the presentation, and
  remember to keep it professional!

developer_bio: I'm a senior Communication Design student at Texas State University.
  My academic and professional focus is in UX/UI, and I have experience in painting
  and illustration as personal creative outlets. I'm playing Baldurs Gate 3 right
  now, (slowly,) and have my sights set on Disco Elysium when I have the time, but
  I primarily have been playing any small indie games I come across on itch.io that
  catch my eye.
