Meet me on the deep net is a tiny browser-based game about intimacy, trust, and establishing connection in anonymity. Inspired by the Tor network's process of forming secure rendezvous points to allow websites to be visited and hosted anonymously, Thabet’s interactive narrative is a protocol drama about crossing an ocean to meet a stranger in search of, or offering connection. The blocky styling evokes text-based games and spreadsheet art, highlighting simple computer aesthetics. Thabet has created a space for optimism and awe in a web that’s increasingly surveilled, extractive, and monopolized. Each of the two journeys makes poetry of the requests and responses our devices make, revering the trust made possible in an open-source, privacy-minded network, supported by volunteers around the world.
