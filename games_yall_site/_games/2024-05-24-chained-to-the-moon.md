developer: ' Corazontintin'
developer_bio: CorazonTinTin intends to explore the vulnerabilities that his inner
  heart mirrors about the complex word surrounding her. She finds the digital realm
  to be a possible safe haven to communicate these feelings, focusing on the idea
  of movement, where the mediums of animation, video, dance, comics and games can
  intersect. Movement holds space for a myriads of truths that are processed differently
  than through a static image, or words of a page. It gives color to the ebb and flow
  of life, rhythm to our machines and fluidity to static constructs. Through movement,
  CorazonTintin hopes to create digital artifacts that allow her audience to both
  learn and play in tandem, and connect ideas that can be a salve to a changing world.
