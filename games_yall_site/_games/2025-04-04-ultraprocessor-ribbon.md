description: Half brick-breaker action! Half erotic visual novel! Follow the story
  of Stella and her computer-turned-android Ribbon as they fight to make old computers
  legal again in the year 2673.
developer: DemureSoft
developer_bio: DemureSoft is a doujinsoft circle based in Austin, TX, formed by Jennifer
  Raye to reject the bleak and cynical outlooks of making independent video games.
  We're carving a new path, one which we hope will inspire others to never lose sight
  of their passions, and to shout them brilliantly from the rooftops. We strive to
  push the agendas of bishoujo, eroge, and doujin in America. We will not rest until
  our city looks like Akihabara.
