Obsolete Adaptor is an interactive dialogic poem made in neverwinter nights 2 (2006) toolset for creating custom modules. They chose this medium out of a personal nostalgia as well as to reflect on things that fall out of use or become obsolete. The dialogue between the Swordsman and the Wizard reflects on virtual time, labor, identity, retirement, and function vs personal fulfillment. The game takes certain inspiration from Ursula K Leguin’s Carrier Bag of Fiction and wouldn't exist without the introduction of family LAN games and the labor of John Romanus’ 20 years as a government employment (2004-2024).
