  The user is invited to explore the ontological debris of a dreamy, semantically-ordered
  universe, suspending objects from three floating cubes, each representing a resultant
  stanza. Through arbitrary selection, a new poem-object is born: experiences reshuffle,
  ideas forcibly enmesh, sub-syntactic counter-currents reverse their course. The
  user will find this process pleasurable and noteworthy. '
