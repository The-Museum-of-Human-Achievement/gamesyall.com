developer: The Draggin' Team
developer_bio: We're a group of friends who have been working on this project remotely
  for about five months. What started as a short term project grew in scope once we
  realized its potential. We're now aiming to publish this game as our first ever
  commercial steam title. Above all, our biggest commitments are making a game that
  we're proud of and refining our skills even further.
