description: ' ART7 is a 1-bit Art Gallery for the Playdate Handheld Console. You
  can download the game and run it on Playdate Hardware or the Playdate Simulator
  included in the Playdate Developer SDK! In ART7 there are pieces from the Indie
  Playdate Dev community, from the Gameboy Camera community, my own work and that
  of other artists at large. There''s a little more game in here than a lot of folks
  might expect actually. Not the most game that could have been, but there are definitely
  some things to be found and discovered.

  ART-O-Ween: Night at the Gallery is a Spooooooky Adventure Game held on an expanded
  version of the gallery grounds. Your night will involve tricks, treats and will
  be a real.. Monster Mash! (I''m not sorry for that at all.) '
