  scientist living in a cabin with just your bugs and a penpal for company. Spoil
  them with pets, minigames, food and furniture. Raise and release bugs to help Beetleback
  Ridge recover from a devastating fire.
developer: ' Elytra Games'
developer_bio: Elytra Games was founded by Beth Rosaschi and Sarah Yu who are partners
  both in the studio and in life. Having met a week before COVID lockdown, they bonded
  over a deep love for video games. They started designing Animal Crossing worlds
  (including a Taco Bell) so that they could go on virtual dates together and a studio
  was born. As a result, Elytra Games is focused on creating beautiful worlds that
  bring people joy and comfort.
