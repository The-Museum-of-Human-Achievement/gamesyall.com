developer: Morgan Taylor
developer_bio: Hello, Morgan here! Tin and I made this as part of an advanced VR game
  development course over the course of ten weeks. I was the level designer and artist
  and Tin made all the sounds for the game. I've always been very interested in walking
  simulators ever since I played my three favorites a couple years back, those being
  Cement Mixer Simulator 2003, Hendecad, and Red Desert Render, which you can find
  on itch! Visit my itch page for other silly and strange games!
