  Studio is a take on how ridiculous and over-the-top games and marketing for kids
  can get. This \"game\" isn't endorsed by Hot Wheels or Mattel (please don't sue
  Kristine) but it hopes to capture the essence of Hot Wheels' big car energy as well
  as paying homage to how sometimes the configurator in a game might be the most fun
  part.
developer: ' Kristine Fernandez'
developer_bio: Kristine Fernandez is a web developer and artist with a focus on creative
  coding. Lately that has meant developing mini games / experiences that aren't necessarily
  supposed to be fun but instead are explorations of a concept and breaking something
  intangible and/or complex into something more tangible, immersive, and engaging
  like a game.
