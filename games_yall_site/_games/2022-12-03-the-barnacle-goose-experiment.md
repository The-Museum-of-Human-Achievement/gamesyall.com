The Barnacle Goose Experiment is an abiogenesis idle clicker game, set in a world where spontaneous generation is commonplace.

You play as a researcher studying the creation of new and living things out of raw and non-living matter. In order to undertake this work without experimental contamination, you are locked inside of a hermetically sealed domeâ€” entirely empty. As such, the only raw material for experimentation is that of your own body.

Through the accretions of self, the slow learning of mechanical systems, and the simple duration of time, you must uncover the combinatory logic of spontaneous generation and make again a living world from a dead one.
