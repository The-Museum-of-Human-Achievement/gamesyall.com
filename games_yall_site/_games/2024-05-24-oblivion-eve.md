  and more in your effort to free the titan who is incarcerated in the shifting prison's

developer_bio: Andrew Julian (SmartAlloc) works as a software engineer and game developer,
  while moonlighting as an indie game developer, his true passion. For over a decade,
  Andrew has been developing games for the smallest and most restrictive environments
  - from calculators to washing machines to chatbots. Now he develops for the Pico-8,
  where he strives to create fun and deep games which can be compressed down to fit
  within the pixels of a 120x120 png file.
