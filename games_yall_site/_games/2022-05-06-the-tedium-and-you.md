description: 'The Tedium and You is an experimental first-person exploration game
  featuring infinite, not-necessarily-Euclidean procedural generation and themes of
  meaninglessness. Getting points is easy: just walk back and forth across a boring
  hallway. But that likely won''t hold your interest. Explore the facility instead
  and find that the more you see, the less you know; halls wrap in on themselves,
  rooms aren''t always where you expected them to be, and you just can''t seem to
  escape the soulless corporate carpeting and ticking clock.


  The game is an exploration of low-grade existential dread, offering a strange commentary
  on the self-definition of meaning. When the world itself has no intention of giving
  you a clear, solid, objective meaning, you either create your own or give in to
  the tedium and quit.


  A solo project by Noah Kuhn, a recent UT graduate, computer scientist, and general
  maker of things.'

The Tedium and You traps the player in an infinite, procedurally generated office building, letting the player wander. The game seeks to uncover how different people react to respond to an interactive experience that gives them next to no stimulus. Presently The Tedium and You is under development.
