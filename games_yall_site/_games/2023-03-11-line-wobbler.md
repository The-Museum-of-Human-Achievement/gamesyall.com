description: Line Wobbler is a one-dimensional dungeon crawler game with a custom  controller
  made out of a door-stopper spring and a five meter long LED strip display. It is
  an experiment in minimalism in game design, use of novel input mechanics, retro
  sound, and the incorporation of physical space into the game.
