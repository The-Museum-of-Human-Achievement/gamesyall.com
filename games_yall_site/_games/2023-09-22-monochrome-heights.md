description: 'Monochrome Heights is a tough-as-nails 2D platformer where you play
  as Happy the Robot, attempting to ascend Layla''s Tower. Help Happy run, jump, and
  slide their way to the top of the tower. But don''t forget Happy''s most important
  and distinctive skill: phasing between black and white. Monochrome Heights is a
  modern retro-style experience, with a high level of difficulty and regular checkpoints.
  The game is inspired by early Super Mario Bros. and Mega Man titles, but brings
  its own unique twist in the form of the phasing mechanic to classic challenging
  platforming.'
