info_sheet_description: Let Me Cook is a multiplayer cooking sim where trial and error
  is the main ingredient. Players grab ingredients from the pantry and test different
  combinations at cooking stations to see what they create. Need a hint? The cookbook
  includes 40+ discoverable recipes. When players land on a successful combo, the
  result is a serving dish they can plate up and enjoy together at the dining table.
