description: UPDOG is a side-scrolling typing game about trying to walk way too many
  dogs at once. I cannot emphasize enough how many dogs there are. It's like... So
  many dogs. Hit the keys mapped to your dogs to keep them from floating away, but
  be careful! If you hit the wrong key, you'll get a lot of updog. Play what our friends
  have called 'the dark souls of dog walking'. UPDOG was created in 2 weeks for the
  PIG Squad Summer Slow Jam - Random Generation.
developer: ' The Keep'
developer_bio: 'Updog was created over the course of a few weeks by a group of friends
