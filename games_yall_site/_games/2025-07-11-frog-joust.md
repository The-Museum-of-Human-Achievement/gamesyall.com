description: Frog Joust is a physical poker-like card game where you challenge fellow
  players into contests of might! Players use cards in their hands as champions to
  compete against each other and gamble coins in a quest to be the wealthiest lord!
  Each champion has an associated strength value, with the larger number winning the
  contest, but worry not, as losing gains you a card from the retribution deck, potentially
  giving you an edge in your following contests. Push your luck or bluff your way
  to victory!
