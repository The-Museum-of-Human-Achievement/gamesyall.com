developer: ' Crimp Games'
developer_bio: Crimp Games is a group of friends in Austin that get together a few
  times a year to work together on games and try to get out of our comfort zone. This
  was our 4th collaboration (following Gob N' Go, Card Cowboy, and Crash Land Crystal)
  and our goal going into the weekend was to make a game that mixed 'clowns' and 'noir'.
  We'd love if folks would wishlist the game on Steam!
