description: ' The Scrolling Exorcise (2022) is an art piece created during the Museum
  of Human Achievement''s residency Welcome to my Homepage. The piece is based on
  the simple idea of utilizing the repetitive motion of scrolling as a catalyst for
  thought. I wanted to create an experience that could only be had within the context
  of the web. Instead of just housing animation or photos on a webpage, the piece
  is about our body''s relationship to the shape of this tool. '
developer: Sara Roma
developer_bio: "Sara Aleyce Roma is an ATX based new media artist, animator, and occasional\
  \ curator, who utilizes video, performance, stop-motion, web animation, free association\
  \ writing, photography and interactive installation. Most recently in her short\
  \ film \u201CA Problem\u201D she explored stop-motion as endurance performance in\
  \ a relationship to a single object. From learning HTML on neopets to studying motion\
  \ media and experimental animation to diving into VJing, ecophilosophy, and phenomenology,\
  \ she pulls inspiration from a variety of fields and subcultures. For a taste of\
  \ what to expect, think of sewing gloves out of lemon peels, customizing viewfinders,\
  \ producing backpacks full of crickets, exploding cakes, and being the first to\
  \ suggest a group exquisite corpse. "
