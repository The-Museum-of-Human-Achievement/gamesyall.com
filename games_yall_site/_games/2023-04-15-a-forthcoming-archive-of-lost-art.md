Josh Kery revisits the occurrence of a theft as an occasion to reflect on art making, record collecting, and preservation with his dad, Peter Kery. Fraudulent movers stole most of Peter’s possessions during a cross country move in 2021.​ Among the things not stolen are his complete vinyl collection and a portion of his photographic portfolio from the 90s. During his residency, Josh created a web archive of audio of stories recorded during a series of interviews paired with B sides of original prints by Peter and A sides of new images by Josh. Album explores objects as memory triggers, and archiving as a way of accepting loss.
