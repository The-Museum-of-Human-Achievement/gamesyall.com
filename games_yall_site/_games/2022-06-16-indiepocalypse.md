developer: Andrew Baillie
developer_bio: Indiepocalypse is a monthly anthology of video and/or physical games,
  simple as that! Every month I (which is to say Andrew, should you see the name around)
  curate a collection of 10 games, bundle them together, and you, (hopefully) buy
  the bundle and get all these games to play for yourself.
