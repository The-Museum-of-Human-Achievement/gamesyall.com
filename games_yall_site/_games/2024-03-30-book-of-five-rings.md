  Inspired by the writing of Musashi Musashino, the art of Hiroshige, and of course
  Bushido Blade, the grandaddy of all one-hit-kill swordfighting games.


  I taught myself 6802 Assembly, coded the whole game, arted up an awesome label,
  and found a guy who builds Atari 2600 cartridges to put one together for me. I''ve
  got a vintage television, original VCS hardware, it''s a fast & fun game, this project
  is gonna steal the show at Games Yall!'
