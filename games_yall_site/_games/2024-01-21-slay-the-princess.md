description: You're on a path in the woods. And at the end of that path is a cabin.
  And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess (Nichole Goodnight). You're here
  to slay her. If you don't, it will mean the end of the world. At least, that's what
  The Narrator (Jonathan Sims) tells you. But can you trust him? Can you trust her?
  Sure, you can do as you're told, killing the entity in the basement, whether she's
  a Princess or... something else. Or you can try to find some other way out of the
  eternity of choices and twisting paths you and the \'Princess'\  have found yourselves
  in. After all... is the world that tasked you to save it really worth saving?

You're on a path in the woods. And at the end of that path is a cabin. And in the basement of that cabin is a Princess (Nichole Goodnight).

You're here to slay her. If you don't, it will mean the end of the world.

At least, that's what The Narrator (Jonathan Sims) tells you. But can you trust him? Can you trust her? Sure, you can do as you're told, killing the entity in the basement, whether she's a Princess or... something else. Or you can try to find some other way out of the eternity of choices and twisting paths youand the "Princess" have found yourselves in.

After all... is the world that tasked you to save it really worth saving?
