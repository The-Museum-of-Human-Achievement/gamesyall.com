developer_bio: Rudy Falagan (b.1999, he/it) is an interdisciplinary artist with a
  BFA in Fine Art from the University of Southern California, Roski School of Art
  and Design. His interests span from internet culture to the materiality of clay
  to the human capacity for information, and oftentimes draws from his own ordeals
  with mental and physical health as a way to analyze the limits of identity creation
  in both digital and analog space. It is very grateful to have the ability to do
  these things.

 Systems at risk!!! What system? The Bachelor Franchise! What ever happened to good old American values? Where (white) men and women looked for love for the Right Reasons? Whatever happened to our heteronormative representation? The pure symbol of the rose?

The solution? Break it even more! Take advantage of its greatest (and messiest) product, Bachelor in Paradise, put it in the Sims 4, and turn it into a study on AI and the construction of “natural” narratives through editing, addition, and omission.
