developer_bio: 'Cloning Marshland is a psychological thriller game told through the
  the eyes of Marshall, our young protagonist, who is returning to this abandoned,
  yet advanced, aquarium to uncover its dark secrets. Marshall’s earth is a world
  that has been ravaged by climate change, and the aquarium will teach Marshall the
  actions of its scientists who tried to fight against that, and some that were selfish
  and didn’t care.


  This is the first project from Round One Games. With Cloning Marshland we hope to
  tell an engaging yet impactful story around the exploitation of animals and the
  impending effects of climate change and what our earth can learn from those lessons.
  Our development team is made up of both mixed entry and veteran level developers
  who are using their talents to make this game a reality.'
