developer_bio: Puppet Combo is an American independent video game development studio
  founded by Benedetto \"Ben\" Cocuzza in 2012 as Pig Farmer Games and based in Brooklyn.
  Puppet Combo's games, such as Nun Massacre (2018) and the critically acclaimed Murder
  House (2020), are mostly survival horror games developed solely by Cocuzza and modeled
  after early PlayStation games and VHS. They are also frequently inspired by 1980s
  horror films, specifically grindhouse and slasher films. Puppet Combo primarily
  releases their games through Patreon and Itch.io. Cocuzza launched Torture Star
