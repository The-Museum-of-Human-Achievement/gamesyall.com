description: 'Warline is a fantasy strategy and tactics board game in which you design
  a unique strategy interactively, then design complex custom combos with your units
  on the battlefield. The game is set against an \"elegant dark fantasy\" backdrop;
  you take on the role of one of Soroyland''s four warring kingdoms, each populated
  by new, non-standard fantasy races. Three unique game modes offer flexible player
  counts (1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-players) and invite you into the history of Warline''s
  world.


  Warline has been likened to, \"Final Fantasy Tactics if you could design your own
  tactical actions with each turn.\"'
