description: Artist and mold enthusiast, June Curry, spent the month in a DIY laboratory
  curating neo-terrariums of fungus, protists, and computer chips to explore the inseparability
  of technology and biology. Her website lovingly documents the specimens as micro-celebrities,
  complete with glamor shots, rock star names, stats, and daily photo updates. In
  her lab diary, Curry catalogs her experiences with caretaking and discovery that,
  as with humans, some molds chose to fully embrace technology while others would
  simply rather die.

developer_bio: June Curry is a multidisciplinary filmmaker and artist based in Queens,
  NY. Since 2017, she has been creating short films, plays, augmented realities, music,
  and mold with an emphasis on the marriage of technology and biology. Her continued
  interest in microbiology and mold as an artform has been a way to explore life cycles,
  map the changes a life goes through, and debate when a death really occurs. Her
  work has been shown to those who ask to see it. Above her art, she wants trans people
  to feel the love they deserve.
