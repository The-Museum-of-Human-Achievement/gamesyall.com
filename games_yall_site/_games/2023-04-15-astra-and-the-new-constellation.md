developer: ' rarelikeaunicorn'
developer_bio: Created by hobbyist developer Travis \"rarelikeaunicorn\" Antosh as
  a passion project over the course of three years, AATNC is their first commercial
  release and an attempt to showcase the power of Pico-8 in spite of its significant
  constraints while also harkening back to the games they played (and the ones they
  didn't get to play!) in their own childhood during the 90s.
