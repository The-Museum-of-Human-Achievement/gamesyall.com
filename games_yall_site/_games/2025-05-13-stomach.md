description: You are a line cook who was recently hired for a cruise ship gig where
  every day you prepare ingredients and make dishes to then deliver to customers.
  However, each night the ship seems to twist and turn against you and its walls sound
  less like its creaking but breathing. However, no matter what you might see, no
  matter what you might hear… YOU. MUST. COOK.
developer: Vertical Fish Studios
developer_bio: Hi! We are a group of college students and aspiring game developers
  who developed this horror game in under 15 weeks for our video game capstone class.
  We wanted to tackle the challenge of making a retro horror aesthetic reminiscent
  of old PlayStation graphics. We are a mix of VFX artists, 3D Modelers, programmers,
  and me as the producer and we're super passionate about continuing to develop the
  game!
