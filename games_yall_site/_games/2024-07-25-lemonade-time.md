developer_bio: 'The year is 2024. One stormy May night a group of friends huddle around
  their Discord call to discuss something they had been planning for months - a low
  stress game jam. What happened over the course of this next week would change their
  lives forever...


  Theatrics aside, this game was made by a group of friends wanting to learn more
  about Godot and keep their game dev skills fresh. We aimed for something low-scope
  and simple in design to help maintain flexibility on the team. Amidst the current
  turbulence of the industry it''s important to be able to remind yourself why you''re
  making games in the first place. This project helped us to do that.'
