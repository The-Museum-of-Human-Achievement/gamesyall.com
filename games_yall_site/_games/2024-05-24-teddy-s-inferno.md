description: 'Teddy''s Inferno is a top-down arcade shooter with Asteroids-style movement,
  heavily inspired by Devil Daggers. The player has to survive as long as possible
  against increasingly frantic waves of enemies, collecting gems to upgrade their
  weapon in the process. The player''s score is purely based on how long they survive.
  Several special game modes are also available, which alter the difficulty or change
  the rules of the game. It''s named after my cat, Teddy (though the game has nothing
  to do with cats).

  The game is complete and out (for free) on itch.io, and I built it solo (using a
  few free assets) with the Phaser 3 game engine.'
