description: 'Set sail! VOYAGE is a map-making game of stories on the sea. Roll dice,
  draw cards, and answer prompts to create the story of your ship and its crew on
  its journey. Catch the wind, make discoveries, and draw your map as you chart your
  voyage. Will you discover an uncharted island? Dangerous pirates? Haunted treasure?
  A big whale?


  VOYAGE is written to be played either on your own or with any number of your friends,
  and works well as a standalone game or as a side game in the middle of an ongoing
  campaign. Based on the Alone Among the Stars ruleset and created by Brendan McLeod,
  a professional video game developer and hobbyist tabletop developer with too many
  projects and not enough time.'
developer: ' Sulcata'
developer_bio: 'Brendan is a designer from Key West, Florida, now living in Texas.


  Brendan''s games are interested in how mechanics reinforce narrative experiences
  and how creative twists can revitalize classic tropes. Tinged with a haze of surrealism,
  his stories aspire to dark sincerity without relying on ugly grit.


  A perennial, ambitious GM, he also designs video games professionally and volunteers
  at a center for wildlife rehabilitation.'
