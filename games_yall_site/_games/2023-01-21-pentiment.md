  From Obsidian, this game is a historical narrative-driven game focusing on character
  development, heavily stylized art, and choice-driven storytelling in early 16th
  century Bavaria. Players will play as Andreas Maler, a clever illustrator caught
  up in a series of murders in Tassing and Kiersau Abbey over the course of twenty
  five years. Players will be responsible for conducting their own investigation to
  decide the fate of the community, but each decision will have lasting consequences
  and inexorably draws Andreas closer to the center of an underlying conspiracy. '
