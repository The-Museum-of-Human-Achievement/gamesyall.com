description: '\"Will you find my body?\"


  the dark is a soft, warm pressure. tells a story about nostalgia, regret, isolation,
  and our relationships to our bodies. It combines experimental text vignettes, surreal
  mini-games, video art, visceral sound design and wistful music. Visual novel-like
  sections are interspersed with various 2D and 3D mini-games. After you complete
  a level, you''re transported back to the hub world, where a body''s parts are progressively
  built up. Each part emits a spatialized looping sound, adding to an increasingly
  noisy texture that you can revisit after each level. The game''s tone shifts often
  from confrontational to contemplative, from scary to sad to silly.


  The fact that we get to borrow our flesh for this long is a miracle.


  Single-player games can sometimes feel isolating/frustrating, but I think they can
  also help us understand each other a bit better.'

"Will you find my body?"

the dark is a soft, warm pressure. tells a story about nostalgia, regret, isolation, and our relationships to our bodies. It combines experimental text vignettes, surreal mini-games, video art, visceral sound design and wistful music. Visual novel-like sections are interspersed with various 2D and 3D mini-games. After you complete a level, you're transported back to the hub world, where a body's parts are progressively built up. Each part emits a spatialized looping sound, adding to an increasingly noisy texture that you can revisit after each level. The game's tone shifts often from confrontational to contemplative, from scary to sad to silly.
