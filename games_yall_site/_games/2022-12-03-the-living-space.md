 The Living Space is a first-person immersive experience which relies heavily on surreal visuals and dream-like sounds. Allowing players to freely roam at their own pace with no defined goals, the environment within the game alters, visually and aurally, based on the player’s gaze and movement. Your surroundings change depending on what areas you go to, yet their locations are not given to you or defined. Thus, the game doesn’t explicitly tell a single story but invites players to explore, look, listen, and take their time, nurturing their own story.
