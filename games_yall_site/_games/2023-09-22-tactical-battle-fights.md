description: 'Tactics. Battles. Fights. Tactical Battle Fights has it all. Unlock
  over 18 unique units, from knights, to pirates, to ghosts, to yetis, as you battle
  your way across the kingdom in a challenging campaign that will have you fighting
  in castles, circus tents, ancient temples, dwarven mining tunnels, and so much more
  before going toe to toe with a fearsome dragon.


  Drawing inspiration from classic 2D tactics games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem
  (but way simpler and sillier), TBF is a 2D browser-based tactics game written entirely
  in vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas. It features charming low-res sprites, an
  incredible 8 bit soundtrack, and a nefarious enemy AI that will give even long-time
  fans of tactics games a lot to think about. So far it requires a mouse and keyboard
  to play, but will have mobile support soon.'
developer: ' Cycle Path Games'
developer_bio: TBF is the first game from Cycle Path Games, a silly studio with a
  silly name that Sean Roulier and Hailey Bobella came up with to describe their collaboration.
  Sean, who works at the Austin Public Library by day, made a soundtrack to a game
  that didn't exist and some silly sprites to go with it, and Hailey, a software engineer
  who works on apps and websites, decided to make it into a browser game that you
  can play (without an engine, for some reason!). This is hopefully the first of many
  games they plan to make together. Here's their silly logo, made by their other best
  friend Kela Kealaki.
