Lose yourself in the relaxing solarpunk breeze of Re:Fresh, a 3D exploration-platformer game where you play as a robot collecting materials to help repair your town after a torrential storm. Explore at your own pace in the open-ended environment and collect solar cells to upgrade your movement options, forging your own path to get the town up and running again.
