description: 'When the Rabbits Sleep: A Narrative Game about Ōkunoshima''s Hidden
  Past places players in the shoes of a young girl working on Ōkunoshima during the
  Pacific War. Through daily tasks, interactions, and mini-games, the game reveals
  the hidden realities of labor, secrecy, and chemical production long kept from the
  public. Between days on the island, players also experience life in the future,
  guiding a mother as she navigates the lingering effects of the island’s secrets.
  When the Rabbits Sleep explores how withheld history shapes lives across generations
  and invites reflection on what remains unspoken.'
