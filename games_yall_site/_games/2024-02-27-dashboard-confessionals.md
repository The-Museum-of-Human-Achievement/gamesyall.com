  \ presentation of this data, consolidated into 6 categories. It borrows from corporate\

In 2022 Jamie DeAngelo began tracking how they spent their time in a conditionally-formatted excel spreadsheet. As an artist who has worked “fairly soullessly” with data analysis in their day job, reclaiming data collection as a meditative personal practice became a gratifying way to find purpose in daily life. Dashboard Confessionals is a humorous, vulnerable, and highly self aware presentation of this data, consolidated into 6 categories. It borrows from corporate visuals of sales growth graphs and web traffic heatmaps, subtly subverted with wiggly hand drawn charts, stories, and metrics chronicling their anxious thoughts, personal judgements, and little treats.
