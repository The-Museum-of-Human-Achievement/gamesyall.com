description: 'The Dance Machine 2000 is a jukebox-inspired vessel that serves up dance
  videos that are as playful, absurdist, and unpolished as the currencies you can
  offer it. Will you choose to give the machine a round of applause or dense fog?
  What sort of dance will it inspire?

  Tay Hall spent their residency month considering alternative economies, ways of
  connecting with dance without the stakes of live performance, and exploring movement
  for camera. Like an old machine, they encountered some rusty parts while returning
  to a practice of video editing and collaboration. The resulting collection of videos
  and interactions are satisfyingly groovy, improvisational, and thoughtful.'
