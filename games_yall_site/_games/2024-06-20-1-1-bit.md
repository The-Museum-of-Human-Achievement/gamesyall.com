description: 'Dying is Feedback. Death is information. 1-1(bit) is a puzzle platformer
  made in Pulp for the Playdate. The platforms are invisible and the player builds
  a mental map of the level layout through traversal and observation... but is there
  more to the game than a grid of dots? You must be dreaming.

  Players Can reveal the level using the B menu. Players also tend Not to do that.

  Inspiration This game was inspired by a similar project shown at Fantastic Arcade.
  It was a beautiful wooden arcade wall mount that consisted of a joystick and a single,
  vertical strip of red LEDs. As you navigated the level you ''viewed'' it 1-pixel
  slice at a time by observing your dot''s position. '
