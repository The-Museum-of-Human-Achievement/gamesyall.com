description: Astra is a young wizard attending Moonrise Academy, a famous but rigorous
  school best known for its night classes, in dreams of becoming a well-known wizard
  capable of complex and difficult spells and magic. However, one fateful chilly December
  evening, Astra overslept and woke up late to his class. Your objective is to help
  Astra collect all 8 of his items needed to pass his final exam in under 10 minutes.
  Will you be able to help Astra pass his final exam, or run out of time?

developer_bio: I am a graphic designer from Brownsville, TX interested in UI/UX for
  video games, typography, branding, and illustration using Adobe programs such as
  Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, and Figma! The closer I get to graduating in Communication
  Design, the more I find graphic design for video games fascinating and an art field
  I'd really love to pursue. I had a ton of fun creating Dormlight Dusk on Figma and
  hope to continue the art of game development in the future!
