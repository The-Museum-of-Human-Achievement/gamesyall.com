 Onto Maizilind Unto Infinity (OMUI) is a game about humankind's suicidal instincts, interweaving grand geopolitical destruction with personal tragedy.

It plays much like any other ‘Gone Home-like’ at first, but when you enter the living room it evolves into an interactive family drama - whereby the childhood desire to play distracts and disrupts the narrative delivery of larger historical exposition and context. As these forces are layered and intermingled, the slow buildup of apocalyptic horror elements crescendo to a climax unlike most other works in the horror genre. OMUI draws more from film, theater, and history to orient itself as it descends into a surreal madness. The pieces are sewn together in a dream-like cacophony, amounting to a world-ending nightmare and heartfelt elegy for the dead.

For those mourners who refuse to forget but have been told over and over ‘the past is the past’, ‘that’s life’, or any other attempt to wave away impactful traumas: OMUI stands like a rock, resolutely relaying the message that the past is always with us, conditioning the present and determining our possible futures.
