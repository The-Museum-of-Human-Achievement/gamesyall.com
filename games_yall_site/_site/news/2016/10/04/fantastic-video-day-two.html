<p>We survived another <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a>! And after a long weekend recovering, we're here with more archived video of nearly all the talks, tournaments, and other presentations given throughout the week of our seventh-annual festival.</p>
<p>All week long we'll be presenting a day-by-day breakdown of all of the videos (<a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1549/news/fantastic-video-day-one/">find day one here</a>), today with last Tuesday's talks. Below the fold you'll find full video covering YANKAI'S TRIANGLE, DAILY MOTIONS, INTO, THOTH, TUMBLESEED & LOOT RASCALS. </p>
<p>You'll also meet Austin's own Owlchemy Labs, creators of slapstick VR hit JOB SIMULATOR & the upcoming RICK & MORTY SIMULATOR!</p>
