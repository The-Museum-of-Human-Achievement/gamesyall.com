<p>As you may have seen by now, we have just announced our plans for this year's <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a> -- the yearly games festival we curate and organize at the <a href="https://drafthouse.com/austin">Alamo Drafthouse</a> alongside the theater's renowned genre film fest, <a href="http://fantasticfest.com/">Fantastic Fest</a>.</p>
<p>Most excitingly, <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/880/news/fantastic-arcade-humble-bundle/">as we did last year</a>, JUEGOS RANCHEROS has commissioned brand new games which will premiere at the festival, from some of our favorite devs, many of whom will be familiar to attendees of our recent meetups (this was our secret orientation plan!).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1329" src="/images/jr-archive/downwellnathalie.png" alt="downwellnathalie"   /></p>
<p>This year's cabinets will include new games from: Ojiro '<a href="https://twitter.com/moppin_">Moppin</a>' Fumoto, creator of <em><a href="http://downwellgame.com/">Downwell</a></em> (above left), together with his frequent collaborator Momo '<a href="http://nemk.tumblr.com/">nemk</a>' Murakami (who created the <em>Downwell</em> illustration at top), as well as <a href="http://www.nathalielawhead.com/candybox/">Nathalie Lawhead</a>, a new festival mainstay behind the <em><a href="http://tetrageddon.com/">Tetrageddon Games</a></em> series (above right), which took home the<a href="http://www.igf.com/2015winners.html"> Nuovo Award at the 2015 Independent Games Festival</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1332" src="/images/jr-archive/sokpopklondike.png" alt="sokpopklondike"   /></p>
<p>We'll also have a new game from Netherlands collective <a href="http://sokpop.co/">Sokpop</a>, made up of the devs behind games like the incredible low-fi sci-fi exploration game <em><a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/bernband/34864">Bernband</a></em> (above left), as well as <a href="http://klondike.fr/">Klondike</a>, the French indie supergroup whose members include the devs of games like <em><a href="https://titouanmillet.itch.io/mu-cartographer">Mu Cartographer</a></em> and the KO_OP-published <em><a href="https://polclarissou.itch.io/orchids-to-dusk">Orchids to Dusk</a></em> (above right).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1315" src="/images/jr-archive/update25-alphabet-1024x576.png" alt="update25-alphabet"   /></p>
<p>In addition to that, we'll also be constructing a brand new cabinet for <em>ALPHABET</em> (above), the game co-created by <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy">Katamari Damacy</a></em> and <em><a href="http://o--o.jp/">Noby Noby Boy</a></em> designer <a href="https://twitter.com/KeitaTakahash/">Keita Takahashi</a> and JUEGOS RANCHEROS co-founder Adam Saltsman. The game was previously only available to Kickstarter backers, and is now being given a wider exhibition for all Fantastic Fest and Fantastic Arcade attendees.</p>
<p>Below the fold is the first press release for the upcoming 2016 Arcade with more information on our arcade cabinets and the first ten games we've chosen as our Spotlight selections. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>FANTASTIC ARCADE RETURNS TO THE ALAMO DRAFTHOUSE WITH NEW GAMES FROM THE CREATORS OF DOWNWELL, PAPERS PLEASE, HOHOKUM &amp; MORE</b></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>SEPTEMBER 26 - 29, 2016</b><br />
<b>AUSTIN, TEXAS </b></p>
<p><i>International Games Festival Features Lineup Of Independent Games, Including Premiere Games, Alongside Major Publisher Showcase</i></p>
<p><b>AUSTIN, TX – August 10th, 2016 –</b> Organizers of Fantastic Arcade have announced the September 26th return of its yearly festival, which showcases the best in independent games. Now in its seventh year, Fantastic Arcade is held in conjunction with Alamo Drafthouse’s Fantastic Fest, the world’s largest genre film festival. This year’s festival will see the premiere of brand new games from the creators of beloved indie titles like <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downwell, Bernband, Orchids to Dusk </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These never-before-seen games will be featured in custom-built, free-to-play arcade cabinets at the Highball event center throughout the duration of Fantastic Fest. They will be displayed alongside a selection of more than 30 independent games from around the world. The first ten of these selected games will make up this year’s Arcade Spotlight, and come from both new developers and returning Fantastic Arcade fan-favorites. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the selection of free play games on display throughout the entirety of Fantastic Fest, Fantastic Arcade will once again feature a number of special events, panel discussions, developer talks, and game tournaments from September 26th through 29th. All games and related events at Fantastic Arcade are free and open to the general public at the Alamo South Lamar theater and adjoining Highball. More information about these special events will be released in the coming weeks, including information on this year’s free ticketing system, which will ensure seat availability at each event or panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2016 lineup of games have been chosen from nearly 250 submissions by Juegos Rancheros, Austin’s independent games collective operated by Adam Saltsman, Wiley Wiggins, Katie Kizziar, Rachel Simone Weil, and Brandon Boyer, alongside Fantastic Arcade Technical Director Joshua Fields. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to selecting the showcase lineup, the Juegos Rancheros team have incubated four of the games that will be premiering at the festival in custom-created arcade cabinets, alongside an assortment of arcade curiosities by artists like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye of the Pyramid</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Alan Watts and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katamari Damacy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creator, Keita Takahashi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fantastic Arcade is to the world of indie gaming what Fantastic Fest is to genre and cult film,” noted Wiley Wiggins, Juegos Rancheros co-founder and Fantastic Arcade Director. “It’s not like any other festival or trade show. It’s a party where the best and brightest outsider talents come to enjoy the company of their audience: both die-hard fans and newcomers. This year, we’ll feature new games from developers whose work has caught our eye again and again with its ingenuity, uniqueness, and artistic flair.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozens more additional games will be announced as part of the full Fantastic Arcade lineup in the coming weeks, alongside special nightly tournaments — an annual fan-favorite tradition —</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> exposition plays, panel discussions, and developer talks. </span></p>
