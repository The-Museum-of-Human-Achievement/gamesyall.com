<p><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/arcade">About Fantastic Arcade</a><br />
Fantastic Arcade fuses the world of independent film and independent gaming.  We bring together artists and professionals who are telling stories and creating experiences in film, games and online entertainment simultaneously.  At Fantastic Arcade, we showcase a curated selection of brand new independent games as well as a larger sampling of important groundbreaking independent games from the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Attendees are invited to play the games as well as interact with the game developers via panels and nightly parties and happy hours.  We also feature both panels with independent filmmakers side by side with game developers and intimate demo sessions by independent game developers.  Lastly, we feel that video games rightfully belong side by side with shorts and feature films at Fantastic Fest. The artistic merit of these games will be honored with both audience awards and a juried competition.</p>
