<p>Attention indies both local and global: <a href="http://www.fantasticfest.com/arcade/submit-your-game/">submissions have been opened</a> for the 2011 Fantastic Arcade -- taking place here in Austin, TX from September 22nd-29th -- with an August 1st deadline already rapidly approaching. </p>
<p>Last year's debut Fantastic Arcade, if you didn't manage to make it, kicked things off in great form, bringing indies like Derek Yu, Cactus, Messhof, Jon Blow, Molleindustria and Superbrothers together for a week of panels, talks and general carousing. </p>
<p>Here's how the festival -- operated by <a href="http://drafthouse.com/austin">Alamo Drafthouse</a>, our local favorite theater organization & an instrumental part of getting JUEGOS RANCHEROS off the ground -- describes itself:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fantastic Arcade fuses the world of independent film and independent gaming. We bring together artists and professionals who are telling stories and creating experiences in film, games and online entertainment simultaneously. At Fantastic Arcade, we showcase a curated selection of brand new independent games as well as a larger sampling of important groundbreaking independent games from the last couple of years.</p>
<p>Attendees are invited to play the games as well as interact with the game developers via panels and nightly parties and happy hours. We also feature both panels with independent filmmakers side by side with game developers and intimate demo sessions by independent game developers. Lastly, we feel that video games rightfully belong side by side with shorts and feature films at Fantastic Fest. The artistic merit of these games will be honored with both audience awards and a juried competition.</p></blockquote>
<p>Selected games will proceed to the second round of submissions and will be asked to provide a playable version of the game for Fantastic Arcade festival programmers. Official selections for the Arcade will be made based on each game's art, story, characters, gameplay and, most importantly, connection with the character of <a href="http://www.fantasticfest.com/">Fantastic Fest</a>.</p>
