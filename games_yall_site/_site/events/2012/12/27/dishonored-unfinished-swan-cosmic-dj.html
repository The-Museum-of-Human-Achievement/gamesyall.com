<p>Want to meet the creators of 2012's breakaway hit <em>Dishonored</em>, learn more about Sony's first-person paint-em-up <em>The Unfinished Swan</em> and take the role of a <em>Cosmic DJ</em> in a late-night dance party? Then join us <strong>Thursday, January 3rd, at 7:00PM</strong> as JUEGOS RANCHEROS returns at its new night and <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">ND Austin</a> venue, where we'll be featuring an unbelievably awesome triple-header bill.</p>

<p>We'll kick off the night with directors' commentary from Raphael Colantonio and Harvey Smith, co-creators of Arkane's  <em><a href="http://www.dishonored.com/">Dishonored</a></em>, more or less unanimously praised as the 2012 Game of the Year. They'll be in conversation with Tiger Style's Randy Smith, and will be on hand to answer all of your questions about the mechanics, the conception and the lore behind the wildly imaginative & viscerally thrilling adventure through Dunwall.</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Following that, we'll be joined by special guest star <a href="http://herotwin.com/">Ben Esposito</a>, lead level designer on Giant Sparrow's PlayStation 3 exclusive <em><a href="http://giantsparrow.com/games/swan/">The Unfinished Swan</a></em>, who will guide us through its fantastically charming storybook world, as well as give us a taste of the other independent game creations coming from this rising indie star developer.</p>

<p>As if that weren't enough, we'll then kick off the night in full dance-party style with a live performance of <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CosmicDjGame">Cosmic DJ</a></em>, the upcoming iPad game from Austin's own <a href="http://gl33k.com/">GL33K</a>, self-described as "a drum machine that loves you", which will allow you, the player, to help create the music in real-time, as you can see near the end of GL33K's preview video above. </p>

<p>And finally, as part of the city's "<a href="http://do512.com/freeweekaustin/">Free Week</a>" series of free, live music performances, we'll also be joined by Austin's own <a href="http://totalunicorn.tumblr.com/">Total Unicorn</a>, who'll finish out the night in their own inimitable electro-psychedelic style demonstrated above.</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Thursday, January 3rd, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">ND Austin</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, dance, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
