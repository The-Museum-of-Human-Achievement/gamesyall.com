<p>What's it like to create new games in 2012 for a machine built in 1983? Come find out <strong>Sunday, May 6th, at 4PM</strong> at our eleventh edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball, as we present the best of home-brewed & bedroom-coded 8-bit games from around the world, and from Austin's very own <a href="http://www.partytimehexcellent.com/">PARTY TIME HEXCELLENT</a>.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/228663643905322">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>Quietly more or less the coolest person in Austin, Rachel 'PARTY TIME HEXCELLENT' Weil has been cooking up her own brand of <a href="http://www.partytimehexcellent.com/selectedworks">8-bit glitched-out amazingness</a> for years, after teaching herself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly</a> in order to tweak Nintendo's first console -- the NES -- to do her bidding.</p>
<p><img src="/images/jr-archive/trackandfeel2.gif" alt="" title="trackandfeel2"   /></p>
<p>You may have seen her visuals gracing the stage behind bands like <a href="http://anamanaguchi.com/">Anamanaguchi</a> or at chiptune music mecca <a href="http://blipfestival.org/">Blip Fest</a>, and this month's meetup will mark the debut of TRACK & FEEL II, a reactive art & music installation piece that lets players remix 80s-8-bit-aesthetic iconography using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Pad">Power Pad</a> -- the Dance-Dance-Revolution-mat predecessor that you probably recall jumping on in sock feet 25 years ago. </p>

<p>In addition to Weil's work, we'll also be giving Austin the chance to play other new/old games like <a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/software.shtml#nes">ZOOMING SECRETARY</a>, an NES "platformer-meets-office-sim" released just a few months ago from Moscow developers Shiru & Pinwizz, which feels essentially one of the best games Nintendo never made.</p>
<p>PARTY TIME HEXCELLENT will be in attendance to tell us a bit about her work on games, installation pieces, and also <a href="http://femicom.org/">the Femicom Museum</a>, her newly-founded repository archiving the overlooked & otherwise hidden history of "games for girls" (see, we told you she was one of the coolest people in Austin).</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, May 6th, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come hang out, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
