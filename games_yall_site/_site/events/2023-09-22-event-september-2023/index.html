<p>Games Y’all returns to the Baker Center Cafetorium! We’re inviting 15 game devs to share their in-progress indie game projects, come join us and explore their work.</p>

                            <p>Forge an explosive arsenal in NIMRODS, the reverse bullet hell roguelite that combines gun crafting and survivor action. Blast through waves of deadly aliens and unlock new characters. Craft powerful weapons on your mission and research them to develop new tech and become the ultimate space hunter! NIMRODS distinguishes itself by enhancing the foundation of survive-em-up games, presenting a profound adventure marked by substantive exploration within a profoundly engaging meta game centered around innovative gun crafting. The concept of gun crafting isn’t simply about assembling conventional weapons, but rather conjuring an assortment of unconventional and whimsical armaments. Fancy a pistol equipped with a sniper scope? You got it. How about an assault rifle that launches homing projectiles, which then divide and detonate upon impact? Absolutely. Perhaps even a shotgun sporting an AK magazine cleverly camouflaged as a banana? You bet.</p>

                            <p>Monochrome Heights is a tough-as-nails 2D platformer where you play as Happy the Robot, attempting to ascend Layla’s Tower. Help Happy run, jump, and slide their way to the top of the tower. But don’t forget Happy’s most important and distinctive skill: phasing between black and white. Monochrome Heights is a modern retro-style experience, with a high level of difficulty and regular checkpoints. The game is inspired by early Super Mario Bros. and Mega Man titles, but brings its own unique twist in the form of the phasing mechanic to classic challenging platforming.</p>

                            <p>Tactics. Battles. Fights. Tactical Battle Fights has it all. Unlock over 18 unique units, from knights, to pirates, to ghosts, to yetis, as you battle your way across the kingdom in a challenging campaign that will have you fighting in castles, circus tents, ancient temples, dwarven mining tunnels, and so much more before going toe to toe with a fearsome dragon.</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from classic 2D tactics games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem (but way simpler and sillier), TBF is a 2D browser-based tactics game written entirely in vanilla JavaScript and HTML Canvas. It features charming low-res sprites, an incredible 8 bit soundtrack, and a nefarious enemy AI that will give even long-time fans of tactics games a lot to think about. So far it requires a mouse and keyboard to play, but will have mobile support soon.</p>

                        <p>TBF is the first game from Cycle Path Games, a silly studio with a silly name that Sean Roulier and Hailey Bobella came up with to describe their collaboration. Sean, who works at the Austin Public Library by day, made a soundtrack to a game that didn’t exist and some silly sprites to go with it, and Hailey, a software engineer who works on apps and websites, decided to make it into a browser game that you can play (without an engine, for some reason!). This is hopefully the first of many games they plan to make together. Here’s their silly logo, made by their other best friend Kela Kealaki.</p>
