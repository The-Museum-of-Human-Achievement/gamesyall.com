<p>Happy New Year! We kicked 2023 off with a Family Edition of Games Y‚Äôall.</p>

<p>We showcased a diverse roundup of games that featured makers of different ages and experience levels. We hoped to connect younger folks interested in indie video games and game development with developers who are excited about their craft! Game developers in attendance were there to share their work, chat with folks, and tell us more about what goes on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Batch Craft Beer offers food and beverages on site as well as ample outdoor space for kiddos to play.</p>

<p>3 - Ozwomp‚Äôs Voyage:
Ozwomp has been invited to a party at the end of the universe - you will accompany him on a voyage through space and time - through darkness and light - through the many worlds we all inhabit. This is a tiny meditation game.</p>

<p>From Obsidian, this game is a historical narrative-driven game focusing on character development, heavily stylized art, and choice-driven storytelling in early 16th century Bavaria. Players will play as Andreas Maler, a clever illustrator caught up in a series of murders in Tassing and Kiersau Abbey over the course of twenty five years. Players will be responsible for conducting their own investigation to decide the fate of the community, but each decision will have lasting consequences and inexorably draws Andreas closer to the center of an underlying conspiracy.</p>
