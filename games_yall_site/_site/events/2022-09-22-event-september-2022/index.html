Players will experience the harshness and warmth in the simpler time of the 1990s, where lots of stories are untold.</p>

                        <p>The common thread between all Hiding Spot Games projects is feeling. The music, art, story, and gameplay all serve that common goal. Hiding Spot Games is an indie game developer based in Austin Texas, with team members scattered around the globe. Their previous game, Flipping Legend, is the highest rated iOS game on MetaCritic for all of 2017. Before that, they made Ephemerid, a musical adventure game that won the IGF award for excellence in audio. Their newest game, Beacon Pines, is their most ambitious project yet.</p>

                            <p>Poem Simulator is an FPS that simulates the abstract process of poem-crafting. The user is invited to explore the ontological debris of a dreamy, semantically-ordered universe, suspending objects from three floating cubes, each representing a resultant stanza. Through arbitrary selection, a new poem-object is born: experiences reshuffle, ideas forcibly enmesh, sub-syntactic counter-currents reverse their course. The user will find this process pleasurable and noteworthy.</p>
