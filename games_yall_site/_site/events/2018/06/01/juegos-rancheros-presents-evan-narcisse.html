Evan’s selections for the night include <a href="http://rezinfinite.com">Rez Infinite</a> (the remaster and re-release of Tetsuya Mizuguchi’s seminal masterpiece Rez) as well as Mike Bithell’s BAFTA-winning <a href="http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/">Thomas Was Alone</a>, a minimalist story-platformer about some boxes that live in a cave. We’ll also check out <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/assassins-creed-freedom-cry">Freedom Cry</a> (originally DLC for Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag) in which players inhabit an assassin in 18th Century Haiti, and Baiyon’s astonishing <a href="http://pixeljunk.jp/library/Eden/">PixelJunk Eden</a>, made in collaboration with Japan’s Q-Games (the influential predecessor to recent smartphone release Eden Obscura).<br />
