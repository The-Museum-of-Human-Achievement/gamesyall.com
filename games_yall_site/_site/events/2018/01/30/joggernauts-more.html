<p>From Minneapolis indie team <a href="https://spacemacegames.com/">Space Mace</a>, and designed by Zachary Johnson — who you'll recognize as the co-creator of Fantastic Arcade favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSj9rw70Ppk">haunted retro console NESpectre</a> — <em>Joggernauts</em> is a co-op party game where players overcome fast-paced obstacles by switching on the fly who is currently taking the lead. Due out for PC and consoles in the coming year, we're giving JUEGOS RANCHEROS goers an early look at this festival favorite.</p>

<p>We'll also be showing a number of other multiplayer favorites, including <em><a href="http://www.tunedout.tv/">Tuned Out</a></em> — a "punk TV broadcast of noisy arcade games", where every game is a TV channel, and players can switch channels as they choose — created by a team of recent graduates from NYU Game Center.</p>
