<p><b><a href="https://fantasticarcade.com//games/2018/cricket-through-the-ages/">Cricket Through the Ages</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free Lives</span></p>
<p>Over a thousand years ago the human race teetered on the edge of extinction. They were helpless against the mighty behemoths of the land. And then, salvation… Cricket was invented! Go alone, or take a friend of your choice, on a journey through the rich, and exquisitely accurate, history of cricket.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2197" src="/images/jr-archive/levedad-3.png" alt=""   /></p>
<p><b><a href="https://fantasticarcade.com//games/2018/Levedad/">Levedad</a> </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solimporta</span></p>
<p>Levedad is a game about capturing time through the contemplative gaze of long exposure photography. It is finding beauty in an ever-changing space where time passes with you and through you.</p>
