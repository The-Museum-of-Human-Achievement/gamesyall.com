                        <p>The team behind "Coffee Talk Episode 2: Hibiscus &amp; Butterfly" continued the legacy of the acclaimed ‘Coffee Talk’. Andrew Jeremy resumed his roles as audio director/composer and project manager, with Dio Mahesa once again taking charge as lead artist and art director. Fredrik Lauwrensius led the programming efforts, supported by Jovan Anggara. Junkipatchi (Junki) stepped in as the narrative designer and lead writer, with assistance from co-writer Anna Winterstein, embracing the vision of the late Mohammed Fahmi to shape the game’s narrative — ensuring fidelity to the original while infusing it with fresh experiences and perspectives.</p>

<p>Coffee Talk Episode 2  marks Junkipatchi’s entrance into the game development world. Having worked in story production, comics, intellectual property, and the entertainment sector since the early 2010s, Junkipatchi is driven by a profound belief in the power of storytelling. This conviction underpins a commitment to articulating personal ideas and forging connections across diverse cultures and languages, utilizing any medium available.</p>

                        <p>Elytra Games was founded by Beth Rosaschi and Sarah Yu who are partners both in the studio and in life. Having met a week before COVID lockdown, they bonded over a deep love for video games. They started designing Animal Crossing worlds (including a Taco Bell) so that they could go on virtual dates together and a studio was born. As a result, Elytra Games is focused on creating beautiful worlds that bring people joy and comfort.</p>

                            <p>Welcome to Instanosis, an interactive platform that combines art, technology and modern musings. Through my work, I aim to push the boundaries of creativity and explore the intersection of digital and traditional art forms. Join me on this slightly absurd journey as we delve into the world of over sharing through questions and discover the playfullness of the digital age. Inspired by online quizzes, probing conversations with coworkers, and a fascination with the far corners of the internet, Oddalys Salcido’s Instanosis serves as a diagnostic tool to help you re-discover the playfulness of the digital-age through the art of oversharing. Follow forking paths of absurdist questions, leading you through portals to shared text documents and curious websites curated by Salcido. Seek digital absolution for your sins, gaze out of someone else’s window, contemplate the boundaries of the physical body online, or explore whatever else your Instanosis prescribes.</p>

                        <h4>About the Developer</h4>
                        <p>Oddalys Salcido is a 1st generation latine queer movement artist and filmmaker from Austin, Texas. As a child they felt cosmically connected to Selena Quintanilla and has been searching for that feeling in everything they’ve done since. Traditionally trained as a choreographer, contemporary dancer and reality TV consumer, Oddalys is a movement inspired filmmaker. With influences of absurdity and tenderness they bring an observant collage of their identities, mental illness and humorous existentialism embedded in both their films, choreography, and instagram captions. They morph into many identities such as a professional dancer for ARCOS, co-founder/director of Preheat Film Festival, web designer for artists, filmmaker, digital composer, tote bag designer, and cyborg. They are passionate about experimenting with contemporary movement and technology as a tool to blend both existing and non existing borders.</p>
