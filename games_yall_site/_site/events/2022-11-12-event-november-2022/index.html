                            <p>Imagine you’re the most popular kid in school. So popular, in fact, that you’re dating every single person in your class. The only problem? You’ve decided to break up with all of them, one by one. HEARTBREAK HIGH is an arcade-style spin on visual novels and dating simulators that asks you to break up with all of your high school sweethearts instead of woo them. A single play-through can be completed in one 20-40 minute sitting, with each break-up featuring a unique branching story path and lovable (or unlovable?) characters for you to crush beneath your feet over and over again.</p>

                        <p>Hi, I’m D. Squinkifer, queer game designer and regular ordinary human, and this is where I live on the internet.</p>

<p>I’m one of the cofounders of Soft Chaos, a worker-owned cooperative that creates critically-engaged, intimate, vulnerable, and unique interactive experiences. Our work includes experimental videogames, tabletop games, larps, art installations, and interactive performances.</p>

<p>You can also check out my solo projects on itch.io, the most recent of which is a videogame album called Squinky and the Squinkettes present: SECOND PUBERTY.</p>

<p>I’ve developed a healthy disdain for social media over the years, so should you wish to communicate with me, email is probably best.</p>

                            <p>Having been in long periods of isolation since the beginning of last year, I began to interrogate my relationship to my body, gender and sexuality. “They Dream of Shapeless Bodies” is the time capsule of that journey. In it, I invite the player to witness the discomfort of my introspection in three different soliloquies. Each conversation features an environment that attempts to illustrate the unease, ecstasy and strife of my self actualization as a black trans person. In this game, you cannot win or lose. You CAN touch but you cannot destroy.</p>
