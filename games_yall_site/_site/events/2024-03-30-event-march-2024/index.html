                            <p>Obsolete Adaptor is an interactive dialogic poem made in neverwinter nights 2 (2006) toolset for creating custom modules. They chose this medium out of a personal nostalgia as well as to reflect on things that fall out of use or become obsolete. The dialogue between the Swordsman and the Wizard reflects on virtual time, labor, identity, retirement, and function vs personal fulfillment. The game takes certain inspiration from Ursula K Leguin’s Carrier Bag of Fiction and wouldn’t exist without the introduction of family LAN games and the labor of John Romanus’ 20 years as a government employment (2004-2024).</p>

                            <p>ILIAGC is something akin to a graphing calculator mixed with a 2D platformer. There are coins to collect, things to buy, and high scores to chase. There’s controller support and "seamless"-ish local multiplayer of up to 4 players I believe.</p>

<p>I started it as a final project for an education class  I was taking (Spring 2023) and decided to keep working on it in the summer. The last update I made to it was on May 30, 2023. I’m currently working on other projects at the moment.</p>

                            <p>For her residency project, Laura M. Cañas P. envisions a poetic economy that centers symbolic creation of art and nature over material capitalism. Classifieds for Poets is a radically tender job board for sensitive creatives, with illustrations inspired by medieval prints. The listings reflect an understanding of the economy as a complex system that regulates resources such as ideas, vital energy, and emotions. The site also features oracle cards, prompting reflections on creative life. Step into the reality Laura has created and consider: “Economy is a fiction. How would you tell the story?”</p>
