                        <h4>About the Developer</h4>
                        <p>Rachel Simone Weil combines approaches from electrical engineering, art history, and DIY culture to create video art and electronic objects that reimagine the history of technology. She has produced glitch art and interactive works for formats ranging from payphones to browsers to 1980s video game consoles to handmade textiles. Weil‚Äôs work is united by playful subversion of historical narratives, often through the creation of fakes and forgeries, to imagine a whimsical playground of electronic artifacts from an imagined past that privileges diverse participation over commercial viability. She has performed, shown work, or curated shows for museums and small DIY shows alike, including Blip Festival (New York), the V&amp;A Museum (London), Glitch Festival (Chicago), and the Living Computer Museum (Seattle). Weil is also the founder of FEMICOM Museum.</p>

                            <p>Josh Kery revisits the occurrence of a theft as an occasion to reflect on art making, record collecting, and preservation with his dad, Peter Kery. Fraudulent movers stole most of Peter‚Äôs possessions during a cross country move in 2021.‚Äã Among the things not stolen are his complete vinyl collection and a portion of his photographic portfolio from the 90s. During his residency, Josh created a web archive of audio of stories recorded during a series of interviews paired with B sides of original prints by Peter and A sides of new images by Josh. Album explores objects as memory triggers, and archiving as a way of accepting loss.</p>
