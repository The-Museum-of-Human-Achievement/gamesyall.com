Each project is unique in its own way, ranging from hiring clowns for a circus to flinging men through a golf course. No matter what, you can guarantee the game you’ll play will be a strange little thing.</p>

                            <p>In 2022 Jamie DeAngelo began tracking how they spent their time in a conditionally-formatted excel spreadsheet. As an artist who has worked “fairly soullessly” with data analysis in their day job, reclaiming data collection as a meditative personal practice became a gratifying way to find purpose in daily life. Dashboard Confessionals is a humorous, vulnerable, and highly self aware presentation of this data, consolidated into 6 categories. It borrows from corporate visuals of sales growth graphs and web traffic heatmaps, subtly subverted with wiggly hand drawn charts, stories, and metrics chronicling their anxious thoughts, personal judgements, and little treats.</p>

                            <p>The Case of the Golden Idol is set in the 18th century where you piece together clues and reconstruct the events of mysterious deaths using a unique drag-and-drop evidence mechanic. The game is brought to life combining early 90ies PC point and click adventure game pixel art aesthetics with late 90ies 3D rendered cutscene visuals.</p>
