                            <p>Dying is Feedback. Death is information. 1-1(bit) is a puzzle platformer made in Pulp for the Playdate. The platforms are invisible and the player builds a mental map of the level layout through traversal and observation… but is there more to the game than a grid of dots? You must be dreaming.
Players Can reveal the level using the B menu. Players also tend Not to do that.
Inspiration This game was inspired by a similar project shown at Fantastic Arcade. It was a beautiful wooden arcade wall mount that consisted of a joystick and a single, vertical strip of red LEDs. As you navigated the level you ‘viewed’ it 1-pixel slice at a time by observing your dot’s position.</p>

                            <p>In Comic Book Boom!, you play as a comics publisher at the height of the industry’s wildest era: The bombastic 1990’s. To score big in this booming market, you’ll need to…</p>

<p>• Publish books with the hottest ’90s themes
• Hype up readers with outrageous stunts
• Dazzle collectors with enhanced cover gimmicks</p>

<p>Be careful: Push the fans too far, and this boom is going to bust. Through big bets and market manipulation, you and your rival publishers might print up a fortune – or get too greedy and lose it all!</p>

                            <p>Lisa Hut’s Memory Palace is a digital scrapbook of weirdly specific pop culture moments. Inspired by the intensity of Y2K era fan sites and tween notebook collages, Lisa Hut created over a dozen web shrines to pop culture memories collected through an anonymous online survey. The pages are layered with cable TV screen grabs, glitter text, and archival GeoCities GIFs re-creating each moment, hyper-personalized with the context the memory-sharers included like where they were or who their celebrity crush was at the time. Visit Lisa Hut’s Memory Palace to dig into the media moments that just won’t leave people’s heads.</p>

                            <p>Power Creeps is a simple and chaotic TTRPG system that blends dice mechanics with party-game style rules. It is played with 2-6 players and 1 Creep Master (CM.) Players cast spells from an ever changing collection of words created by the group at the start of the game. The players work together as a party to pursue and acquire their one true Desire.</p>
