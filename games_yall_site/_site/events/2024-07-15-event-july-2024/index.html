                        <p>Bridgebourn is a solo passion video game project currently being developed by me, Bamboo Bandit (Siavash Ranjbar) since 2016. My love of travel, nature and childhood gaming experiences inspired me to create something that can bring that same joy to others. I practiced illustration throughout my youth and picked up programming in grade-school to fulfill this dream. The time has finally come to make this project a reality.</p>

                        <p>The year is 2024. One stormy May night a group of friends huddle around their Discord call to discuss something they had been planning for months - a low stress game jam. What happened over the course of this next week would change their lives forever…</p>

<p>Theatrics aside, this game was made by a group of friends wanting to learn more about Godot and keep their game dev skills fresh. We aimed for something low-scope and simple in design to help maintain flexibility on the team. Amidst the current turbulence of the industry it’s important to be able to remind yourself why you’re making games in the first place. This project helped us to do that.</p>

                            <p>I am using Notion to dispatch a research project that speculates the relationship between my avatar/alias self (@$#@) and an astronomer named Noor. @$#@ plays the role of a cyber anthropologist who discovers an archive from Noor, who happens to be the last astronomer from Earth. Here, I am researching in public as an invitation to discover different modes of making truths (or otherwise) in storytelling. You will find the webpage used as a collecting ground for ongoing research notes, images, and some voice memos reciting @$#@’s discovery.</p>
