Navigate volatile conversations &amp; unravel mysteries in this narrative adventure about trust, self-destruction, &amp; shifting identities.   Vessels is an IGF award winning 2-3 hour, character-driven story, in which no one is exactly who they appear to be… even you. With the help of the enigmatic Voice, rewind time and control the other crew members  to explore, manipulate, and gain control. Experience atmospheric, environmental storytelling as you piece together clues on a ship reeling from a grisly death and spreading paranoia.

                        <p>6 students from Austin, Texas worked together since August 2019 to create Vessels. Originally inspired by a twine by the team’s lead, John Baxa, the game builds on the team’s shared love of sci-fi, story, and interest in creating a meaningful, entertaining game. The team hopes players enjoy the characters, story, and ideas in Vessels.</p>

                            <p>This is a simple prototype for an alternate way of typing using a gamepad without using an on-screen keyboard. It’s designed similar to a radial menu, with the four primary buttons (ABXY) each housing a different menu containing 8 letters. The user selects the letter they wish to type from the menu using the joystick. ControllerType is an alternative, faster way of typing using a gamepad that avoids an onscreen keyboard, instead opting to use a radial menu.  While this is mainly just a prototype, there are a variety of options included to help make this method of typing as approachable as possible (as well as a few other surprises hidden inside).</p>

                        <p>VIDYA GIRI is an artist from Houston, TX. Her art is reflective of her background: balanced between cultures, environments, and disciplines. Her work has spanned between online spaces, printed media, projection, and painting on physical and digital canvases. Her (current) explorations revolve around collecting from one’s surroundings as a form of reflection and the parallels between natural and human-made identities and the environments they encompass.</p>
