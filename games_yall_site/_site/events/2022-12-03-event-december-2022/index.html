The story takes you down the paths of Locke, Jeanne and Primus in a world just waiting to be discovered and cracked open.</p>

<p>Follow along on a progression through the psychedelic in multiple color palettes. Try to hold on to your sanity through mind bending visuals, cinematic camera angles and logic twisting story and you may discover‚Ä¶who is Yoko?</p>

                        <p>Howdy; my name‚Äôs Seppi, and I‚Äôm an indie game developer. I am an active member of the L√ñVE community. I‚Äôve been making games for years now, and I‚Äôm always interested in helping prospective indie developers out.
One of the paradoxes I‚Äôve learned over the years, especially as a software developer, is the more I know, the more I realize I don‚Äôt know. I quote;
Only a fool would take anything posted here as fact.</p>

Allowing players to freely roam at their own pace with no defined goals, the environment within the game alters, visually and aurally, based on the player‚Äôs gaze and movement. Your surroundings change depending on what areas you go to, yet their locations are not given to you or defined. Thus, the game doesn‚Äôt explicitly tell a single story but invites players to explore, look, listen, and take their time, nurturing their own story.</p>

                            <p>The Barnacle Goose Experiment is an abiogenesis idle clicker game, set in a world where spontaneous generation is commonplace.</p>

<p>You play as a researcher studying the creation of new and living things out of raw and non-living matter. In order to undertake this work without experimental contamination, you are locked inside of a hermetically sealed dome‚Äî entirely empty. As such, the only raw material for experimentation is that of your own body.</p>

<p>Through the accretions of self, the slow learning of mechanical systems, and the simple duration of time, you must uncover the combinatory logic of spontaneous generation and make again a living world from a dead one.</p>

<p>The solution? Break it even more! Take advantage of its greatest (and messiest) product, Bachelor in Paradise, put it in the Sims 4, and turn it into a study on AI and the construction of ‚Äúnatural‚Äù narratives through editing, addition, and omission.</p>

                        <p>Rudy Falagan (b.1999, he/it) is an interdisciplinary artist with a BFA in Fine Art from the University of Southern California, Roski School of Art and Design. His interests span from internet culture to the materiality of clay to the human capacity for information, and oftentimes draws from his own ordeals with mental and physical health as a way to analyze the limits of identity creation in both digital and analog space. It is very grateful to have the ability to do these things.</p>
