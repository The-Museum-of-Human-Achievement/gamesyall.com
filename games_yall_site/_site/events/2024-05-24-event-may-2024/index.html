                            <p>Teddy’s Inferno is a top-down arcade shooter with Asteroids-style movement, heavily inspired by Devil Daggers. The player has to survive as long as possible against increasingly frantic waves of enemies, collecting gems to upgrade their weapon in the process. The player’s score is purely based on how long they survive. Several special game modes are also available, which alter the difficulty or change the rules of the game. It’s named after my cat, Teddy (though the game has nothing to do with cats).
The game is complete and out (for free) on itch.io, and I built it solo (using a few free assets) with the Phaser 3 game engine.</p>

                        <p>CorazonTinTin intends to explore the vulnerabilities that his inner heart mirrors about the complex word surrounding her. She finds the digital realm to be a possible safe haven to communicate these feelings, focusing on the idea of movement, where the mediums of animation, video, dance, comics and games can intersect. Movement holds space for a myriads of truths that are processed differently than through a static image, or words of a page. It gives color to the ebb and flow of life, rhythm to our machines and fluidity to static constructs. Through movement, CorazonTintin hopes to create digital artifacts that allow her audience to both learn and play in tandem, and connect ideas that can be a salve to a changing world.</p>

                            <p>Every Letter is a letter writing game where you write letters on a typewriter based on characters’ requests. (If you’re familiar with Violet Evergarden, it was a heavy inspiration.) The game is mechanics-light with the player freely writing based on the requests, and it includes multiple small side stories scattered across these requests.
Every Letter first came out a couple years ago and has since been ported to Steam and localized into multiple languages, with one more update on the way. I developed most of the game, but my friend (XtlusArt) made an illustration for it, and a whole bunch of translators made the various localizations possible (Locasaurus, Lucie Teulières, Sasha Boucheron, Sarah Deville, Anabel Morales, Ōkami, Hasanh, Ayliz Yıldız, Haigang Zhou).</p>

                            <p>Meet me on the deep net is a tiny browser-based game about intimacy, trust, and establishing connection in anonymity. Inspired by the Tor network’s process of forming secure rendezvous points to allow websites to be visited and hosted anonymously, Thabet’s interactive narrative is a protocol drama about crossing an ocean to meet a stranger in search of, or offering connection. The blocky styling evokes text-based games and spreadsheet art, highlighting simple computer aesthetics. Thabet has created a space for optimism and awe in a web that’s increasingly surveilled, extractive, and monopolized. Each of the two journeys makes poetry of the requests and responses our devices make, revering the trust made possible in an open-source, privacy-minded network, supported by volunteers around the world.</p>
