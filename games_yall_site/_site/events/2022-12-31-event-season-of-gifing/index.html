<p><a href="https://discord.gg/zUGqntHu">Join Our Discord</a></p>

<p>Let’s celebrate the end of 2022 by making animated GIFs for each other! Think secret santa, but more pixels and more lolz. Sign up by Dec 9, submit on Dec 31.</p>

<p>○ Friday Dec 9 - Sign up deadline. Join the discord channel!</p>

<p>○ Friday Dec 16 - Do-si-do! We’ll tell you who you’re making a .GIF for and what their prompt is. Interpret your prompt however you wish - get literal, get festive, get silly.</p>

<p>○ Saturday Dec 31 - Post what you made in the #season-of-gifing channel and tag your partner!</p>

<p>☁️🌵 Swing your Partner 🌵☁️
○Howdy Y’all! This channel is shared between the Fantastic Arcade and The Museum of Human Achievement Discord Servers so game devs and artists can hang out and make stuff together.
○We’re using Connections Bot, which has some quirks. Emoji reactions are turned off, but other features seem to work fine. Let us know if anything seems funky.
○Add some inspo to your wishlist to inspire your dream GIF. This could be a favorite phrase, song, cozy location, pastry, deodorant scent, texture, type of cat, etc!</p>

<p>🎨 Animated GIFs?! 🎨
○ Even if you’ve never made a GIF before, we encourage you to join in and give it a shot!
○ GIFs can be made on a computer or smartphone from photos, drawings, pixel art, game engine exports, screenshots, video clips, etc.
○ Try opening a .gif in Photoshop or Gimp to see what its guts look like. You can “remix” an existing GIF this way by altering the individual frames of the animation</p>

<p>☃️ Sign Up ☃️
○ DM @Rachel or @Jay that you’d like to join and we’ll assign you the Season of GIFing role.
○ In your DM include your email address and your wishlist.
○ Your wishlist should serve as a prompt for someone else to make your GIF.
○ You’ll receive a message on Friday Dec 16th telling you who you’re making something for and what their prompt is!</p>

<p>❄️ Rules/Details ❄️
○ We’re here for a good time! Keep it friendly and positive. When in doubt, read the #rules.
○ Don’t leave your GIF recipient hanging! By opting in, you are agreeing to make and post a GIF on Dec 31st.
○ Questions? Contact @Jay RG#4863 or @Rachel Stuckey#8121 on Discord or by email at <a href="mailto:jay@themuseumofhumanachievement.com">jay@themuseumofhumanachievement.com</a> or <a href="mailto:rachel@themuseumofhumanachievement.com">rachel@themuseumofhumanachievement.com</a></p>
