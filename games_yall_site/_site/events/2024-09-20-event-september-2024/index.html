For over a decade, Andrew has been developing games for the smallest and most restrictive environments - from calculators to washing machines to chatbots. Now he develops for the Pico-8, where he strives to create fun and deep games which can be compressed down to fit within the pixels of a 120x120 png file.</p>

                            <p>Jo Suk’s Revision on Reunification is a digital memorial for the Arch of Reunification, which stood in Pyongyang, North Korea from 2001 to 2024. Its intentional demolition by the North Korean government confirmed a new era for South-North relations on the Korean peninsula, characterized by open antagonism. This inflection point follows decades of failed efforts at peaceful reunification, incurred in part by U.S. interventionism. Though now nonexistent, the Arch of Reunification continues with a new nature through this digital memorial, one that personalizes, politicizes, and questions the posthumous symbolism of the monument.</p>
