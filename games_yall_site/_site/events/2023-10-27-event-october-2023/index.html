<p>Osiel has a special power - they can see the truth of how other people feel about them! Using their abilities, navigate a party and see the truth about who’s a friendly face, and who’s just faking it.</p>

<p>Halloween Party in Hell is a short interactive game about perception and meeting new people. Choose where you stand with various party guests, and make new friends - or enemies. The game prioritizes interactivity with a focus on "wide" over "tall" storytelling.</p>

You’ll use gumption and a balloon pump to explore and unravel the mystery of Clownside!</p>

                        <h4>About the Developer</h4>
                        <p>Crimp Games is a group of friends in Austin that get together a few times a year to work together on games and try to get out of our comfort zone. This was our 4th collaboration (following Gob N’ Go, Card Cowboy, and Crash Land Crystal) and our goal going into the weekend was to make a game that mixed ‘clowns’ and ‘noir’. We’d love if folks would wishlist the game on Steam!</p>
