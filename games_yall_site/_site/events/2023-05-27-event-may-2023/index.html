                            <p>Bounce Bat is an Austin inspired arcade game where you play as a little bat flapping your way through town trying to eat bugs and cause trouble!</p>

<p>String together aero-bat-ic combos as you bounce through bustling city streets and chomp down on a buffet of bugs across an Austin inspired procedural environment.</p>

<p>Play single player or face off against your friend. Have a chill flight or test your skills in challenge mode.</p>

<p>Bounce Bat was initially created during the ATX Game Maker’s Jam in early 2023 and is still under development. It is being developed by Nic and Brieyh’leai, an Austin-based game dev duo who’ve been making goofy games together since 2016!</p>

<p>A game made in Wasm4, a fantasy console without all the bells and whistles. Wasm4 supports many compiled languages, my favorite being Zig. There are merely 15 functions and 64kb to use, cartridges come with rollback multiplayer and save states built in.</p>

<p>Wasm4 makes low-level and new programmers feel at home, use your own text editor, language of choice, and sprites can even be drawn in binary!</p>
