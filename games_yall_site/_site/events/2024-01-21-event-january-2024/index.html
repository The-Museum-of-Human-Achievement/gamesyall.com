                            <p>HouseKeeping is an Isometric Couch Co-Op party game similar to Overcooked or Splatoon. Two teams of players must battle for control of the House. The Keepers (House Cleaners) must clean the house. While the Cats must destroy the house and of course cause chaos. Whoever has more control of the house at the end of the round wins. We hope to take this game further and hopefully publish it at some point!</p>

If you don’t, it will mean the end of the world. At least, that’s what The Narrator (Jonathan Sims) tells you. But can you trust him? Can you trust her? Sure, you can do as you’re told, killing the entity in the basement, whether she’s a Princess or… something else. Or you can try to find some other way out of the eternity of choices and twisting paths you and the 'Princess’\  have found yourselves in. After all… is the world that tasked you to save it really worth saving?</p>

You might be familiar with Abby’s work from her decade-long career as a graphic novelist, where she wrote and illustrated such works as The Crossroads at Midnight, The Last Halloween, The Earth Before Us, and Junior Scientist Power Hour. You’re probably not familiar with Tony’s work outside of games, though he did a stint doing analytics for The Boston Globe.</p>

<p>Tony and Abby live in Toronto with their cat (Spoons), their ball python (Wednesday) and their Axolotl (Nubs).</p>
