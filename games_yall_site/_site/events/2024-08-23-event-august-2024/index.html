                            <p>The Dance Machine 2000 is a jukebox-inspired vessel that serves up dance videos that are as playful, absurdist, and unpolished as the currencies you can offer it. Will you choose to give the machine a round of applause or dense fog? What sort of dance will it inspire?
Tay Hall spent their residency month considering alternative economies, ways of connecting with dance without the stakes of live performance, and exploring movement for camera. Like an old machine, they encountered some rusty parts while returning to a practice of video editing and collaboration. The resulting collection of videos and interactions are satisfyingly groovy, improvisational, and thoughtful.</p>

                            <p>UPDOG is a side-scrolling typing game about trying to walk way too many dogs at once. I cannot emphasize enough how many dogs there are. It’s like… So many dogs. Hit the keys mapped to your dogs to keep them from floating away, but be careful! If you hit the wrong key, you’ll get a lot of updog. Play what our friends have called ‘the dark souls of dog walking’. UPDOG was created in 2 weeks for the PIG Squad Summer Slow Jam - Random Generation.</p>

                            <p>Prometheus Unbound is a 2D stealth platformer with graceful speed and machine-precision movement. The player controls Anala Piers, a cyborg-corpse laborer under the control of CarpoTech. Anala regains consciousness and immediately seeks answers and revenge for what happened to her. Gameplay includes fast-paced parkour movement and jumps, as well as stealth mechanics like sneaking, hiding, and wall sticking. Each stage is timed, allowing players to re-attempt levels for faster times, or even to challenge the clear times the developers set! In addition to the main story levels, there are five challenge levels where players can test their platforming and parkouring abilities to the limits. In addition, many levels are open to explore in multiple ways, allowing the player to find hidden collectibles and other areas. Following its release in March, Prometheus Unbound made the longlist for the 2024 Yugo BAFTA Student Awards.</p>

                        <p>The Prometheus Unbound team formed to create the game as a group project in UT Austin’s 2D game design capstone course. The six of us came from many disciplines within the university, including programmers, film background, artists, and music. Our team is made up of Luke Mason, Jake Gollub, Cory Mason, Arnold Venter, Ainsley Johnston, and Rodrigo Okamoto Corbelli.</p>
