<p>Never got your chance to be inducted into The Jejune Institute, the amazing real-world game that transformed the city of San Francisco into a magical & mysterious playground? Then it is crucial that you join us at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> <strong>next Thursday, November 7th, at 7:00PM</strong>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a free screening of <a href="http://www.theinstitutemovie.com/">The Institute</a>, the newly released documentary that takes "invites viewers down the rabbit hole into a secret underground world teeming just beneath the surface of everyday life."</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/629927440391169">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>Any attempt to describe The Jejune Institute will always fall short of just how fantastic the experience was -- from being first led into an intimidating Financial District skyscraper, to being given your first mission & re-emerging into the San Francisco streets to find that <em>the clues had been around you all along</em>, to hiking through the park with a transistor radio to pick up pirate radio broadcasts that you never knew existed & realizing that the plot was thickening by the minute.</p>

<p>But watching The Institute does an amazing job of carrying you along for the ride you might have missed, and introducing you to the game's creators, participants & key figures, only to discover that behind the curtain -- there are only more curtains.</p>
