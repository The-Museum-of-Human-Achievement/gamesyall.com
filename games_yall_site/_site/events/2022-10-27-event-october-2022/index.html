                            <p>ART7 is a 1-bit Art Gallery for the Playdate Handheld Console. You can download the game and run it on Playdate Hardware or the Playdate Simulator included in the Playdate Developer SDK! In ART7 there are pieces from the Indie Playdate Dev community, from the Gameboy Camera community, my own work and that of other artists at large. There’s a little more game in here than a lot of folks might expect actually. Not the most game that could have been, but there are definitely some things to be found and discovered.
ART-O-Ween: Night at the Gallery is a Spooooooky Adventure Game held on an expanded version of the gallery grounds. Your night will involve tricks, treats and will be a real.. Monster Mash! (I’m not sorry for that at all.)</p>

                            <p>Untitled Stair Game is a Survival-Horror game with a main focus on Survival. It is being made by Roy Ott and Steve Gutierrez. The game is about the player’s journey down a seemingly infinite staircase. To survive inside the staircase, the player will scavenge supplies and craft tools to aid in their descent. But where could this staircase lead? It is hard to tell… it is just so dark. The game is currently in early alpha, and we hope to collect useful playtest data for our primary gameplay loop.</p>

                            <p>“The Waiting Machine” is a website and digital art project where people could go get distracted while waiting for results of any type of applications, especially the ones that involve big, complex bureaucratic systems, such as governments, companies, and universities. Ranran Fan (b. China) is a device-maker and an artist who works in photography, new media, installation, and performance. She invents various devices as solutions to explore the absurd existence of the free individual female subject under an oppressive political and patriarchal environment. Through these devices, she is able to create a separate world as an alternative mode of existence.</p>
