                        <p>Hi I’m Flan, I’m an indie dev in New York City, I also teach here at the NYU Game Center.
I like to make strange, emotional, and funny experiences in Unity. I like to use ripped assets and recontextualize them. My latest game got an AMAZE award which is pretty cool.</p>

                            <p>Card Cowboy is a short, silly adventure game about using cards to explore the Wild West and try to get revenge on a Gunman ‘who killed your dad, wooed your mom, and kicked your dog’. Your cards represent different cowboy core concepts like Gun, Lasso, Whiskey, and Horse and when you use them in different situations the game tries to build on or make jokes around your expectations.</p>

<p>You TOO can get revenge! Card Cowboy’s voice actor Max Hudetz will be attending our February meetup to do a live reading! Form a team and shout your moves for a live version of Card Cowboy!</p>

                            <p>Onto Maizilind Unto Infinity (OMUI) is a game about humankind’s suicidal instincts, interweaving grand geopolitical destruction with personal tragedy.</p>

<p>It plays much like any other ‘Gone Home-like’ at first, but when you enter the living room it evolves into an interactive family drama - whereby the childhood desire to play distracts and disrupts the narrative delivery of larger historical exposition and context. As these forces are layered and intermingled, the slow buildup of apocalyptic horror elements crescendo to a climax unlike most other works in the horror genre. OMUI draws more from film, theater, and history to orient itself as it descends into a surreal madness. The pieces are sewn together in a dream-like cacophony, amounting to a world-ending nightmare and heartfelt elegy for the dead.</p>

<p>For those mourners who refuse to forget but have been told over and over ‘the past is the past’, ‘that’s life’, or any other attempt to wave away impactful traumas: OMUI stands like a rock, resolutely relaying the message that the past is always with us, conditioning the present and determining our possible futures.</p>

                            <p>Fetch Quest is an adventure game inspired by the tropes of classic Japanese RPGs. As a dog, your day to day routine consists of sleeping, eating, and playing fetch! But what adventures would the dog have if he decided to wander off the beaten path? Currently being built up by a small team of ACC grads, this is a super early build of the game, but we’re excited to see an audience response!</p>

                        <p>Working under the name Liz Dexia, gender-fluid artist Keith Womak took a dive into the world of Drag to discover what it means to be a Drag performer and in some cases, what it means to be human. After arriving in Austin 7 years ago from a background in illustration and fashion design, Drag became the focus for their creative pursuits. Using costume, performance, illustration, and a pandemic-fueled foray into video production, they have decided to bring these skills, themes, and ideas from Liz’s world into a more exploratory and interactive space.</p>
