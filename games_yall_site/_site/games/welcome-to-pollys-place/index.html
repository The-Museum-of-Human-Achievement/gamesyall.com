                        <p>Welcome to Polly’s Place is an interactive fiction meant to bring about the nostalgia of early 2000’s internet culture. From taking care of digital pets to getting harassed on fan forums this time period was unique in the strangest way. We were just figuring out that the internet could be used to connect more people than ever before. These connections are the focus of this project. The friendships that weren’t possible before the fear of the millennium bug. The people we talked to daily on game sites that have now become inactive. People who are just as real to us as we are to them. Even if you can’t speak to someone face to face, your connection to them is still worthwhile. Polly’s Place aims to blur the line between an "internet friend" and a "real friend" if not erase it completely.</p>
