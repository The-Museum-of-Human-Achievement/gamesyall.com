                        <p>For her residency project, Laura M. Cañas P. envisions a poetic economy that centers symbolic creation of art and nature over material capitalism. Classifieds for Poets is a radically tender job board for sensitive creatives, with illustrations inspired by medieval prints. The listings reflect an understanding of the economy as a complex system that regulates resources such as ideas, vital energy, and emotions. The site also features oracle cards, prompting reflections on creative life. Step into the reality Laura has created and consider: “Economy is a fiction. How would you tell the story?”</p>

                    <h4>About the Developer</h4>
                    <p>Laura M. Cañas P. (Medellín, Colombia, 1992). Artist and Journalist. Based in Austin, TX, USA.

Laura´s work is developed at the intersection between art and journalism. Her main mediums are linoleum, comics, etching and digital illustration. Her creative work is made from her perspective as a Latina woman. With her art she explores the themes of the feminine, gender violence, the power to heal, resilience and relationships within nature. She is also interested in the questioned relationship between Global North-South, and in new ways of thinking such as decolonization and alternative economies.</p>
