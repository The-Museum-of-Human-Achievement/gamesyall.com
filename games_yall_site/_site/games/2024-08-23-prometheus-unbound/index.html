                        <p>Prometheus Unbound is a 2D stealth platformer with graceful speed and machine-precision movement. The player controls Anala Piers, a cyborg-corpse laborer under the control of CarpoTech. Anala regains consciousness and immediately seeks answers and revenge for what happened to her. Gameplay includes fast-paced parkour movement and jumps, as well as stealth mechanics like sneaking, hiding, and wall sticking. Each stage is timed, allowing players to re-attempt levels for faster times, or even to challenge the clear times the developers set! In addition to the main story levels, there are five challenge levels where players can test their platforming and parkouring abilities to the limits. In addition, many levels are open to explore in multiple ways, allowing the player to find hidden collectibles and other areas. Following its release in March, Prometheus Unbound made the longlist for the 2024 Yugo BAFTA Student Awards.</p>

                    <h4>About the Developer</h4>
                    <p>The Prometheus Unbound team formed to create the game as a group project in UT Austin’s 2D game design capstone course. The six of us came from many disciplines within the university, including programmers, film background, artists, and music. Our team is made up of Luke Mason, Jake Gollub, Cory Mason, Arnold Venter, Ainsley Johnston, and Rodrigo Okamoto Corbelli.</p>
