The work of French Modernists as well. But, the aesthetic pleasure I experience with both is tinged with an undercurrent of unease. To me, they will always be haunted by the image of the Asian woman as ‘Lotus Blossom.’”—Kaitlin Hsu 

Plans for a Garden is a series of web poems located within a map of Claude Monet’s Giverny garden. The work addresses a trope in Western art to stereotype Asian women as delicate and decorative by representing them as inanimate objects such as flowers. Curious to disentangle her aesthetic love of flowers from these harmful connotations, Kaitlin Hsu cultivates her thoughts in a variety of formats. The webpages include concrete poetry, a collection of animated gifs, a prompt for embodiment, and an interactive desktop. Traverse the garden and see where your mind wanders. 

Perfect for fans of experimental poetry formats, approachable film theory, Asian cultural studies, art history, and feminism—as well as for those who feel conflicted about something they love.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oM3b8u9xs-ORUtIgGyJ6B7avJEHvY6Vr,https://plansfora.garden/,Explore,https://myrefoli.github.io/,Kaitlin Hsu,,"Kaitlin Hsu is a queer Taiwanese poet, translator, and editor from the Bay Area.

Pairing the fictional game with his own fictional persona, Edwards highlights the ways military-sponsored video games like Counter Strike and Call of Duty exploit cultural mythology and twist historical narratives to encourage political support. The project depicts a young fan defending and excusing the problematic aspects of a piece of media he connects with, paralleling the defense and excuses extended to the disastrous 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion. It synthesizes the artist’s experiences in exploring dead online communities into a fabricated artifact of a nonexistent community, while mirroring and investigating his own lived experience.
