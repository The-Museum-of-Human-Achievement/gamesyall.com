______________________________________________________   
  
Disclaimer: This show is meant to be a fun and silly environment for humans to showcase themselves and their animal friends. Participants should be aware that we will try our best to accommodate, however there will be an audience and some of the things that go along with that (applause, general excitement, lights) We in no way want to cause any animals or people discomfort, fear or general un-happiness, therefore please keep this in mind if submitting. We think there are probably some great animal friends that would like (or be indifferent) to a moment in the spotlight, but want to make sure any participants meet the following criteria:   
  
*Animal and owner are good friends. There is mutual respect, understanding, and solid relationship with the human and their animal friend.   
  
*Your pet won't be uncomfortable or leave with un-due stress while sharing a moment in the spotlight (we will have a quiet room where owners and their animal friend can wait before the show and move to after... we expect the whole on stage thing to last 3-5 minutes) If your pet is small and prefers not to leave their container/home, we can provide a small camera which can be projected onto a screen so the audience would be able to see without getting close.   
  
*Your pet was acquired under thoughtful conditions (we're not trying to promote or condone any systems of animal cruelty or illegal acquisition of pets).
