Central Machine Works is a craft beer brewery built in an old metal fabrication shop that produced a variety of custom parts starting with airplanes in WWII (1940-2016). They have a large food menu, cocktails, and plenty of non-alcoholic beverage options! There is a parking lot behind the brewery off of 5th street, you'll find us in the back of the brewery.
