Fantastic Arcade presents Games Y’all 🕹️ at the Museum🖼️!
  
Have you been to our homebase, MoHA? The Museum of Human Achievement is like that really fun/weird relative who shows you avant-garde art and takes you to get snacks whenever you want. Come hangout and play a fresh roundup of community submitted indie video games! Every month the Games Y’all community gathers to play games, talk about projects, and connect to our local indie games community.
  
🖥️ You can also meet the CATS+! The Collaborative Art + Technology Situation (CATS+), a new program at The Museum of Human Achievement, groups artists and tech wizards to collaborate on projects and share their processes. Come get curious about art + technology with projects, performances, experiments, and processes from CATS+ resident artists and tech wizards.
  
👾 Also on view is pfft: an evastars retrospective created by Rachel Weil and FEMICOM Museum for Welcome to my Homepage. A retrospective celebrating the underground pixel-art subculture led by teenage webmistresses of the early 2000s.
  
Donate what you can! Space is limited, RSVP please.
