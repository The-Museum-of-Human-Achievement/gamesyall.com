- description: 'i feel so much shame is a browser-based interactive narrative made
    from scanned Risograph prints. Inspired by Risograph animation techniques, it
    offers a meditation on shame and desire as told through interactive and animated
    buttons, hyperlinks, inputs, and background gradients made embodied and material,
    with each and every moment of the website existing in printed form. Through a
    laborious process of printing, scanning, and realigning over 700 images and making
    them interactive with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the making of the piece–in all
    of its effort, repetition, and imperfections–also becomes one of its core realizations.

- description: 'During her Welcome to my Homepage residency, Antonia Bustamante collected
    websites that inspire her, ranging from net art, poetry, and tools, to archives,
    newsletters, and community resources. They are arranged as a series of unmarked
    doors, allowing for chance explorations, countering the algorithmically determined
    pathways of social media feeds and search engines. A sidebar also provides an
    indexed list of the links, for quick scanning and intentional browsing. Heading
    the page are poetic questions and concepts, in Spanish and English, that guide
    the curation of the project and invite you to ponder the gesture of a website
    that leads you outside of itself. The project beckons you to wander its halls,
    or hop to a destination from the directory - each bringing a small joy and a new
    destination on Antonia’s personal map of the web.
