Games Y’all showcases indie games and digital art projects from our local community and beyond. You can come to our meetups to play games, experience digital art, and connect with the local Austin games community. Games Y’all celebrates, amplifies, and supports the unique and underrepresented within indie games and beyond.

##### IDGA

The mission of the International Game Developer Association - Austin (IGDA - ATX) chapter is supporting and empowering game developers in the greater Austin area to achieve fulfilling and sustainable careers, along with bridging the gap between both new and old game devs.

##### EGaDS

The Electronic Game Developers Society (EGaDS!) at UT Austin is an interdisciplinary student organization open to all UT Austin students with a passion for game development. Our mission is to help students grow as developers while fostering a supportive and welcoming community.

##### The Museum of Human Achievement

The Museum of Human Achievement is a multi-disciplinary art space and non-profit organization in Austin, Texas. We cultivate new work, community, and vibe by providing radically affordable arts space to support artists and audiences in the creation of new ideas.
