# Come on Down!™

## a Game Show Game Jam

#### Sat 10/22 - Sun 10/23, 2022

It’s a game show. It’s a jam. It’s a game show jam!   
Come to the Museum of Human Achievement this weekend to collaborate on your very own GAME SHOW! No experience needed or minimum time requirement to participate, just come have fun.

  
  
  

#### Timeline

##### Kickoff - 11am on Saturday 10/22

Hear the scoop, meet your teammates (or bring your own), get inspired with weird game show clips, sign up for bonus challenges, and enjoy some cold brew (thanks Texas Coffee Traders!) and a cereal buffet. Can’t make it Saturday but still want to join in? Tell us on the team finder!

##### Open workspace - 11am-9pm Sat & Sun 10/22-10/23

Jam with us! 2 days of access to collaborative workspace, mentors (for making things with computers and hands), tools, computers, a big pile of cardboard, and as many encouraging remarks as you need. This is an optional resource! If you’d rather work somewhere else, go for it. It’s also up to you and your team how much time you spend making your game show.

##### Submission deadline - 9pm on Sunday 10/23

Times’ up! Tell us what it’s called, who made it, and what you’re doing. We’ll give you a time slot at the showcase.

##### Showcase - 8pm Thurs 10/27

Hosted by the infamous Shannon Stott and Coby West during our [Halloween Games Y’all event](https://gamesyall.com/html/event-october-2022.html). Put on your game show in front of a live studio audience at the MoHA outdoor stage! Also broadcast live on Discord! Bring your friends and fam.

  

#### Who is this for?

Game devs and coders, artists and performers, musicians and sound effect artists, costume and prop designers. But really, anyone who wants to collaborate and have fun together. No experience necessary.

  

#### A Game Show?

Think quiz show, dating game, obstacle course, three door situation, gross slime challenges, total gameshow nonsense. Up to you!   
Fully analog theatrical productions, multi-player video games, and everything in between are encouraged.   
Make something to be presented on stage with a live studio audience in mind.   
Play-through should be 5 minutes or less. Set up and clean up should be 5 minutes or less.

#### Teams

A successful team might have: programmer, designer, digital artist, narrative designer or writer, musician or sound effects person, props and set designer, costume designer, game show host, physical computing designer. But don’t take our word for it! If you want a team of all puppeteers, cool. 

  

#### Venue Details

We are a warehouse space next to the Canopy Arts Complex. If you see a pink and blue trailer, an old city bus, and some astroturf – you’re in the right place.   
There is plenty of parking available and a bike rack.   
This event will be indoors in the MoHA gallery space and outdoors at the MoHA drive-in theater (AKA the parking lot). The outside temperatures are the inside temperatures, so dress accordingly.   
We strongly encourage that everyone be vaccinated or have recently tested negative for COVID. Do not attend if you feel ill or were recently exposed to COVID. Hand sanitizer and wipes for controllers will be available. Masks are welcome!   
Our space is wheelchair accessible. If you need access to the lift, just ask!
