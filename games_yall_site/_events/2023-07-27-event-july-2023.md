We're going south y'all! Our July meetup will feature all indie tabletop games developed right here in Austin 🎲♟️🃏🧩
  
Let's hang inside, cool down with some AC, and play some games! We'll have 5 tables run by our guest developers and 1 table for open play. Prior to the event you will receive an email where you can choose which games and which sessions you want to join.

You can come to our meetups to play games, experience digital art, and connect with the local Austin games community.
