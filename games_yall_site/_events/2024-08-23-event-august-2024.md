This August, we are celebrating Pride! Our Games Roundup will focus on projects developed by LGBTQ+ creators, and/or projects that prominently feature queer characters or the queer experience!
  
Shout out to Austin Public Library and our new friends at the Howson Branch. Not only are they our wonderful hosts but they are helping provide snacks, bevs, and some sweet surprises!

##### Games Y'all

Games Yâ€™all is a monthly meetup presented by the Museum of Human Achievement for indie devs, digital artists, and games fans. We showcase indie games and digital art projects from our local community and beyond. You can come to our meetups to play games, experience digital art, and connect with the local Austin games community.

##### The Museum of Human Achievement

The Museum of Human Achievement is a multi-disciplinary art space and non-profit organization in Austin, Texas. We cultivate new work, community, and vibe by providing radically affordable arts space to support artists and audiences in the creation of new ideas.
