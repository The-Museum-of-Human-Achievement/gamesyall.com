Happy New Year! We kicked 2023 off with a Family Edition of Games Y'all.

We showcased a diverse roundup of games that featured makers of different ages and experience levels. We hoped to connect younger folks interested in indie video games and game development with developers who are excited about their craft! Game developers in attendance were there to share their work, chat with folks, and tell us more about what goes on behind the scenes.

Batch Craft Beer offers food and beverages on site as well as ample outdoor space for kiddos to play.

##### Games Y'all + Fantastic Arcade

Games Yâ€™all is a meetup presented by Fantastic Arcade & The Museum of Human Achievement, held every month at venues around Austin for indie devs, digital artists, and games fans.
  
Fantastic Arcade celebrates, amplifies, and supports the unique and underrepresented within indie games and beyond.
