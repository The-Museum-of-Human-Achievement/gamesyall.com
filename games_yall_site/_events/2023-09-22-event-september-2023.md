Games Y’all returns to the Baker Center Cafetorium! We’re inviting 15 game devs to share their in-progress indie game projects, come join us and explore their work.
  
You can talk to the makers, share some feedback, and experience a variety of games at different stages of development. This is a great opportunity to learn what goes into making games as well as giving valuable insight to the game developers in attendance.
  
Shoutout to Mighty Coconut for helping facilitate the space!

##### Games Y'all

Games Y’all is a monthly meetup presented by the Museum of Human Achievement for indie devs, digital artists, and games fans. We showcase indie games and digital art projects from our local community and beyond. You can come to our meetups to play games, experience digital art, and connect with the local Austin games community.

##### The Museum of Human Achievement

The Museum of Human Achievement is a multi-disciplinary art space and non-profit organization in Austin, Texas. We cultivate new work, community, and vibe by providing radically affordable arts space to support artists and audiences in the creation of new ideas.

##### Venue + Parking

It's a big yellowish school building. Guests can park anywhere in the parking lot or street. The entrance door faces 39th street. There will be signs directing you from the parking area to the entrance! Look for traffic cones and folks gathering :) We'll have beer and non-alcoholic drinks available. All ages welcome, wristbands for 21+ who want to drink, ID check at the door. Please do not explore beyond our designated area for gathering!
