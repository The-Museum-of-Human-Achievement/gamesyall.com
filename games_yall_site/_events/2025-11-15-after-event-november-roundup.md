# Games Y'all Roundup

We've got double the trouble comin your way for November!

To close out an amazing 2025, we've got not only our November GY Meetup -- but an official afterparty with live music at Kick Butt Coffee! Join us at one or both for awesome games, live music, and great times!

##### Venue + Health Details

This event will be indoors. We strongly encourage that everyone be vaccinated or have recently tested negative for COVID. Do not attend if you feel ill or were recently exposed to COVID. Hand sanitizer and masks will be available. Masks are welcome!

##### Games Y'all

Games Y’all showcases indie games and digital art projects from our local community and beyond. You can come to our meetups to play games, experience digital art, and connect with the local Austin games community. Games Y’all celebrates, amplifies, and supports the unique and underrepresented within indie games and beyond.
