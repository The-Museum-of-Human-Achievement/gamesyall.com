<p>Still high from the excitement of last month's JUEGOS RANCHEROS virtual-reality puzzler SUPERHYPERCUBE? Ready for virtual reality to be your real reality? Join JUEGOS RANCHEROS this Thursday, February 4th at 7:00 PM at the North Door as we present a magical, musical, and wildly immersive VR experience being developed right here in Austin: TheWave by Aaron Lemke and Finn Staber!</p>
<p>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1558272981162280/" target="_blank">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</p>
<p>TheWave is a room-scale VR environment that allows the player to create music and accompanying visualizations. Beat a virtual steel drum, stroll into a fully-functional, three-dimensional audio sequencer, or just chill out and watch the dazzling lights. Leek (<a href="http://www.unellodesign.com">Unello Design</a>) and Staber (<a href="https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?page_id=29385">Portalarium</a>) will be on hand at the North Door to tell us a bit about the development of TheWave and usher you into their 3D audiovisual landscape.</p>
