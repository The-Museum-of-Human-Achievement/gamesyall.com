<p>In our estimation he's one of the best and most undersung interactive artists working in videogames today, and <strong>this Thursday, December 4th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, we'll take a look back at the work of New York based artist <a href="http://vectorpark.com/">Vectorpark</a>, including the debut of his upcoming iOS game, <em><a href="http://metamorphabet.com/">Metamorphabet</a></em>.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/395639173924107/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>

<p>Probably best known for his 2009 adventure game <em>Windosill</em> on <a href="http://ptrlvn.us/windosill">iOS</a> and <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/37600/">Steam</a> (pictured below), Vectorpark was a pioneer of interactive web art, and is a reigning champion at creating both dreamlike environments and creatures which inhabit them that all feel unbelievably tactile and alive.</p>

<p>We'll have a number of these early and more recent works on display at the ND, and will also be giving Austin the first chance to play his latest game, <em><a href="http://metamorphabet.com/">Metamorphabet</a></em>, an "interactive, animated alphabet" which, says Vectorpark, "presents the 26 letters of the alphabet as a series of luminous and unexpected transformations,Â inviting playful participation from kids and adults alike."</p>
<p>All the games will be playable beginning <strong>this Thursday, December 4th, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
