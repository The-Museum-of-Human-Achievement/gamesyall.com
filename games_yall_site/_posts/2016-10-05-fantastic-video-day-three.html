<p>We survived another <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a>! And after a long weekend recovering, we're here with archived video of nearly all the talks, tournaments, and other presentations given throughout the week of our seventh-annual festival.</p>
<p>All week long we'll be presenting a day-by-day breakdown of all of the videos (find <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1549/news/fantastic-video-day-one/">day one here</a> and <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1555/news/fantastic-video-day-two/">day two here</a>), today with last Wednesday's talks. Below the fold you'll find full video covering the creation of games on "weird hardware", an amazing exhibition of the "haunted" Nintendo Entertainment System, and sci-fi drone sim DUSKERS. </p>
<p>You'll also see Nathalie Lawhead create an entire new game — live! — and go in-depth with DOWNWELL creator Moppin, before the world's first (?) head-to-head DOWNWELL tournament, capped off with our second-annual ARENA GODS tournament!</p>
