<p>You're invited to join us <strong>Sunday, June 18th at 7:00 PM</strong> at the <a href="http://www.themuseumofhumanachievement.com">Museum of Human Achievement</a> for the opening exhibition of <em><a href="https://jenniferraye.itch.io/boa-retina">Boa Retina</a></em>, created by our Spring 2017 resident artist, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenn_raye">Jennifer Raye</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1461679477222356">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</strong></p>
<p><em>Boa Retina</em> is a physical, multi-device game that "dives deep into messy gender uncertainty," through "an uncomfortable blend of abstract golden-age arcade design, retro computer aesthetic, the unhealthy ways my gender feelings manifested before coming out, and external conflicts from things trying to keep life in order." </p>
<p>Following the exhibition, a digital version of the game will be <a href="https://jenniferraye.itch.io/boa-retina">publicly released on June 30th on itch.io</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get an early preview, Raye will be exhibiting a segment of <em>Boa Retina</em> at the Museum of Human Achievement <strong>this Friday, June 9th, at 7pm</strong>, alongside the work of MOHA's own resident artist, <a href="http://matthewkeff.com/">Matthew Keff</a>. </p>

<p>The full <strong>arcade of anything</strong> event, however, will kick off at 7:00 PM at the <a href="http://www.themuseumofhumanachievement.com">Museum of Human Achievement</a> in Austin, TX. Admission is free, but donations--which help fund this and other <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">JUEGOS RANCHEROS</a> programming--are warmly accepted.</p>
<p>[<em>Created in partnership with the Museum of Human Achievement, the <strong>arcade of anything</strong> artist residency encourages its participants to push into experimental and unexplored territory within digital arts. More information on our residency program <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/residencies/">can be found here</a>.</em>]</p>
