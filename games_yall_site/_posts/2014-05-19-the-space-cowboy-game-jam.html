<p>Doing anything particularly romantic between May 24th and June 8th? No? Good, because I'm super happy to announce that Venus Patrol is organizing the first in what I hope becomes a regular series of game jams, this time dedicated to the lonesome future west-world theme: <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">the <em>space cowboy</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">game jam</a>, hosted with the help of <a href="http://itch.io/">itch.io</a>, is open to developers worldwide, and will run for two weeks, after which it will be judged by players for the week following on a variety of to be determined criteria like romance and psychedelia.</p>
<p>The idea for the jam came, obviously, after I finally got it together to watch all of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop">Cowboy Bebop</a> in one crazy week-long marathon (which I suggest you do or re-do in advance) and realized no game had quite struck that perfect tone the series did -- an ineffable feeling I also get from Cory Mcabee's film <a href="http://www.corymcabee.com/americanastronaut/">The American Astronaut</a> and Lisa Hanawalt's web-comic <a href="http://lisahanawalt.com/tagged/coyote-doggirl">Coyote Doggirl</a>.</p>
<p>And hopefully you'll find that feeling just as evocative and inspiring, because just as exciting as the jam itself is news that our Austin indie collective <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">JUEGOS RANCHEROS</a> will be showcasing the best of the games from July 2nd through the 6th in the real-life mystical West Texas high desert town of Marfa, as part of the <a href="http://www.marfafilmfestival.com/">Marfa Film Festival</a>. </p>

<p>A few of us just got back from Marfa late last night, where we met with Film Festival organizers & location-scouted the area we'll be carving out and dedicating to your Space Cowboy games, and there's a whole lot of expectation from all parties involved that This Is Going To Be Really Cool for the thousands of people that attend the Fest.</p>
<p>We'll be putting out more detailed information <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">at the official Space Cowboy Game Jam site</a> and open up for your submissions on the 24th of this month, but in the meantime start clearing off your calendar, dreaming up big ideas under an endless starry sky & discussing collaborations on twitter via the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23spacecowboygamejam&src=tyah">#spacecowboygamejam</a> -- we're all crazy excited to see what you come up with!</p>
