<p>Want to wind down the year with one of our favorite multiplayer games of 2016? Then be sure to join us <strong>Thursday, December 1st, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a multiplayer monthly, headlined by <em>Multibowl</em>. </p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1790067254599674/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>First presented back at <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1414/events/multibowl/">our monthly meetup in September</a>, and then again with a headline tournament at Fantastic Arcade, <em>Multibowl</em> quickly became one of this year's most popular JUEGOS RANCHEROS mainstays, and (as you can witness for yourself in the video below) with very good reason!</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Multibowl</em> — if you haven't yet been introduced — gives two players a fast-paced series of tiny fragments of emulated games collected from the past 30+ years, and keeps a running meta-tally of each player's success. </p>
<p>The compilation was co-created by <a href="https://twitter.com/bfod">Bennett Foddy</a> (creator of <em><a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>, <a href="http://www.foddy.net/GIRP.html">GIRP</a></em> & one of the leads behind <em><a href="http://sportsfriendsgame.com/">Sportsfriends</a></em>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/bad_tetris">A.P. Thomson</a> (himself co-creator of the recently released local favorite, <em><a href="http://beglitched.net/">Beglitched</a></em>).</p>

<p>Because it can currently only be played at exhibitions and events, we wanted to give Austin one more chance to spend some time with a brand new version of one of our 2016 favorites — complete with new, never-before-multibowl'd games that weren't part of any previous showcase!</p>
<p>The games will begin <strong>Thursday, December 1st, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>, with a short introduction at 8:00PM. The show is free, all ages, and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
