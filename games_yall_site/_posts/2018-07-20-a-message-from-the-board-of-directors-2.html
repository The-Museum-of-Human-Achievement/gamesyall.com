<p>Juegos Rancheros has completed its review of conduct concerns regarding the organization's former president, Brandon Boyer. Spanning numerous individuals and incidents, the reports we received indicate a pattern of unacceptable behavior toward women, including emotional manipulation leading to fear of professional retaliation. Thus, we stand by our decision to dismiss Boyer from the board and any future leadership roles in Juegos Rancheros, including Fantastic Arcade and other Juegos Rancheros-sponsored events. We thank all those who came forward to bring light to these incidents, and we ask our local and online communities to join us in respecting their privacy.</p>
<p>Making inclusive spaces requires consistent, challenging work. We have taken a number to steps to help to make things right, including improving our <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/safe-spaces/">Safe Spaces Policy</a>, instituting an incident response team, and growing our Board of Directors to maintain fresh, diverse voices in leadership. We will provide more information about all of these steps in an upcoming blog post.</p>
