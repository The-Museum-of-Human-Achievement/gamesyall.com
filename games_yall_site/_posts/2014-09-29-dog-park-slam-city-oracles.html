<p>Want to spend your Thursday night wrestling a pitbull to the ground & high-fiving a pizza as you lose yourself in a 'giddy apocalypse'? Then come join us <strong>this Thursday, October 2nd, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> as we present the local double-feature premiere of Kevin Cancienne's local multiplayer dog-em-up <em>Dog Park</em> & Jane Friedhoff's <em>Slam City Oracles</em>.</p>

<p>Developer Cancienne -- also known for his design work on area/code's early classic iPhone puzzle game <em><a href="http://ptrlvn.us/drop7">Drop7</a></em> -- has described <em><a href="http://dogparkgame.com/">Dog Park</a></em> as "a fighting game without the fighting", a four-'person' brawler where players choose their dog & score points for chasing, wrestling, cavorting & gamboling in perfectly-pitched canine fashion. </p>
<p>Various JUEGOS RANCHEROS organizers have also described it as "omg the best game ever".</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Dog Park</em>, we'll also be showing <em><a href="http://slamcityoracles.com/">Slam City Oracles</a></em>, a two-player body-slammer by <a href="http://janefriedhoff.com/">Jane Friedhoff</a>, with art by <a href="https://twitter.com/q_dork">Jenny Jiao Hsia</a> & music by <a href="http://www.prophetsandkings.net/">Prophets & Kings</a>.</p>

<p>Already drawing a number of favorable comparisons to <em>Katamari Damacy</em> <a href="http://kotaku.com/a-game-about-two-girls-gleefully-breaking-the-world-1639774978">from sites like Kotaku</a> for its cheerfully chaotic cartoony slapstick physicality, <em>Oracles</em> is a vertically-oriented game where two girls have four minutes to joyfully & wantonly break the entire world around them. </p>
<p>Both games were commissioned for the <a href="http://gamecenter.nyu.edu/event/no-quarter-exhibition/">NYU Game Center's No Quarter exhibition</a> -- the yearly local-multiplayer focused show which has spawned games like <em>Nidhogg, Bara Bari Ball</em> & <em>Bennett Foddyâ€™s Speed Chess</em> -- and were first debuted there September 19th, alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/metasynthie">Naomi Clark</a>'s consensual card game <em>Consentacle</em> and <em>Corporate Vandals</em>, a physical game from Shawn Allen, creator of <em><a href="http://beatdowncity.com/">Treachery in Beatdown City</a></em>.</p>
<p>Both games will be making their local debut <strong>Thursday, October 2nd, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
