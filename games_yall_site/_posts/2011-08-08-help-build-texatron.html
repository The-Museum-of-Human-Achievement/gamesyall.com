<p>Thanks to everyone who <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/54/events/texatron-edition/">came out yesterday afternoon</a> to get a glimpse of what's to come with our TEXATRON initiative! <a href="http://infiniteammo.ca/">Alec</a> gave an awesome speech about the philosophy & the friendship behind the <a href="http://winnitron.ca/">Winnitron</a>, we got a ton of positive feedback about bringing it to Austin, and a number of you have already expressed interest in helping us make the TEXATRON amazing!</p>
<p>We'll be keeping track of everyone who wants to volunteer their time, energy & goodwill to the project and sending out a newsletter as we need people. If you'd like to help, simply send an email to:</p>
<p><center><a href="mailto:texatron@gmail.com">texatron@gmail.com</a></center></p>
<p>and we'll make sure you're in the loop!</p>
<p>For everyone else that simply wants to follow our efforts, point your Twitter streams in the direction of:</p>
<p><center><a href="http://twitter.com/texatron">@texatron</a></center></p>
<p>and we'll let you know when there's something to know. We look forward to talking more about it with you all soon!</p>
