<p>From Luckshot Games, <em>Sausage Sports Club</em> is a "physics-sports game about adorable, floppy animals competing on a reality TV show" for up to 8 players. We'll be giving Austin an early look at the game, due out very soon for <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/574120/Sausage_Sports_Club/">Windows, Mac</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sausage-sports-club-switch">Nintendo Switch</a> from this now-Austin-based indie studio!</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Sausage</em> we'll be bringing you more amazing single- and multiplayer games, both newly released or due soon and worth looking forward to! We'll also have our usual 'indie alley', featuring a fantastically diverse lineup of in-progress games brought in by Austin's local videogame community! </p>
<p>We'll be showcasing all these games and more <strong>Thursday, March 1st, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>, with a short introduction at 8:00PM. The show is free, all ages, and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
