<p>As the holiday season winds down, we want to help ring in the new year with a bang (& a slice), so join us <strong>next Thursday, January 2nd, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a selection of multiplayer games, headlined by <a href="http://teknopants.com/">Teknopants</a>' just-released instant-classic <em><a href="http://samuraigunn.com">Samurai Gunn</a></em>.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/594076607329118">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>

<p><em>Samurai Gunn</em> made a strong debut right here in Austin during 2012's Fantastic Arcade, which first propelled it into the public eye. Now fantastically polished, further expanded, and given <a href="http://doseone.bandcamp.com/album/the-samuraigunn-ep">one of 2013's best game soundtracks</a> by underground hip-hop legend <a href="http://doseonesite.tumblr.com/">Doseone</a>, we'll be presenting this "lightning-fast Bushido brawler" on the big screen for a low-key but high-action multiplayer night.</p>

<p>We'll have an additional lineup to-be-announced multiplayer games on hand as well -- possibly along with a few prizes for the best samurai in town -- so be sure to bone up on your sword/gunn-play over the next week & join us in making the new year memorable, straight off the bat.</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Thursday, January 2nd, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, play, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
