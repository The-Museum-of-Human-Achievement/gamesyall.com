<p>It's one of 2018's most anticipated indie games, but did you know its roots lead straight back here to Austin? Come find out what we mean <strong>Thursday, April 5th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a brief history of <em><a href="http://minitgame.com/">MINIT</a></em>, the 60-second adventure game. </p>
<p>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1857478201218165/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</p>
<p>Created by Kitty Calis, JW Nijman, Jukio Kallio & Dominik Johann — a supergroup collectively known for their work on games like <em>Nuclear Throne, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Luftrausers</em>, and <em>Dr. Langeskov</em> — <em>Minit</em> sees players trying to lift a mysterious curse which ends each day after just one minute. </p>

<p>Due for <a href="http://minitgame.com/">PC, PS4 and Xbox One release on April 3rd</a>, from Austin's own Devolver Digital, we'll be giving Austinites the opportunity to experience those minute-long loops themselves, alongside a short introduction about the making of the game, as well as a selection of other games from its creators.</p>
