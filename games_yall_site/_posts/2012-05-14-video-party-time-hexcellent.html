<p>It's true we haven't been the best at documenting our regular monthly meetups over the past year, but we're working on it! In addition to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JuegosRancheros/photos">new photo galleries</a> over on the Facebooks (soon, hopefully, also to be ported over here), we have the above: 10 minutes of Rachel '<a href="http://www.partytimehexcellent.com/">Party Time! Hexcellent!</a>' Weil's self-intro from <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/184/events/party-time-hexcellent-edition/">our most recent edition</a> of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at the Highball. </p>
<p>Also, if you still can't get enough PT!H!, there's <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/girly-games-games-for-girls-and-girls-who-game-a-conversation-with-femicoms-rachel-weil/">an awesome, lengthy interview</a> with her over at The Mary Sue (given <a href="http://jezebel.com/5909810/on-girl+centric-video-games">big-ups by none less than Jezebel</a>), discussing her personal past history playing & interacting more directly with games, and more on what she plans to do with the <a href="http://femicom.org/">Femicom Museum</a>, the site she's just set up to catalog both the personal <em>and</em> professional history of "games for girls".</p>
