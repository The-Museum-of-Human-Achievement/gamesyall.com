<p>You're invited to join us <strong>this Friday at 7:00 PM</strong> at the <a href="http://www.themuseumofhumanachievement.com">Museum of Human Achievement</a> for the unofficial <a href="http://www.fantasticarcade.com">Fantastic Arcade</a> afterparty, as we celebrate the work of <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1443/news/fall-2016-resident-artist-robby-kraft/"><strong>arcade of anything</strong> Fall 2016 resident artist</a> Robby Kraft.</p>
<p><strong>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/321184501569779/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.robbykraft.com">Robby Kraft</a> (NYC) is perhaps best known for his work in origami. His breathtaking and organic forms, created from the careful folding of paper, have been exhibited internationally.</p>
<p>During his monthlong arcade of anything residency, Kraft has applied his interests in geometry, scale, and play to the world of virtual reality. <em>Shifting Sand Lands</em> is an experimental sandbox rendered simultaneously in virtual and physical worlds. In advance of the opening, you can keep tabs on the development of <em>Shifting Sand Lands</em> on Kraft's <a href="http://arcade2016.tumblr.com">arcade of anything devlog</a>.</p>

<p>For opening night, Kraft will be joined by <a href="http://nathanielober.com/">Nathan Ober</a> and his work <em>The Observer or the Observed?</em>, a sound installation inspired by astrophysics, microtonal sound, and Buddhist thought. We'll also have refreshments, our world-famous Fantastic Arcade cabinets set up for free play, and a special musical guest that you won't want to miss.</p>
<p>The <strong>arcade of anything</strong> event kicks off at 7:00 PM at the <a href="http://www.themuseumofhumanachievement.com">Museum of Human Achievement</a> in Austin, TX. Admission is free, but donations--which help fund this and other <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">JUEGOS RANCHEROS</a> programming--are warmly accepted.</p>
<p>[<em>Created in partnership with the Museum of Human Achievement, the <strong>arcade of anything</strong> artist residency encourages its participants to push into experimental and unexplored territory within digital arts. More information on our residency program <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/residencies/">can be found here</a>.</em>]</p>
