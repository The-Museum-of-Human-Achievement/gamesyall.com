<p>We introduced Austin to <em>Sportsfriends</em> mainstay <em>Johann Sebastian Joust</em> <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/30/events/fantastic-arcade-thunderbeam/">a full three years ago</a> (!), and again many times since, but -- with the collection having <a href="https://vine.co/v/MnxbHVWPjQ0"><em>just</em> passed Sony certification</a> and been cleared for release on PS3 & PS4 -- this will be the first time to catch <a href="http://sportsfriendsgame.com/">the final version of all four <em>Sportsfriends</em> games</a> under one roof!</p>

<p>As you can see previewed in the video above, included will be Foddy's <em>Pole Riders</em>, Ramiro Corbetta's <em>Hokra</em>, Noah Sasso's <em>BaraBariBall</em>, and... what's this? Hmmmmm... I can't quite tell, but it feels like a version of <em>J.S. Joust</em> that will feel right at home in Austin... </p>
<p>With any luck, we'll also have some wicked prizes for the local champions, so you're definitely going to want to meet us <strong>Thursday, May 1st, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, play, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
