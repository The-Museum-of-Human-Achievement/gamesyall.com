<p>Headlining the event will be Boneloaf's upcoming slapstick party-game <em><a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/gangbeasts">Gang Beasts</a></em>, already a verified indie cult hit, where players "grab, push, pull, punch, and throw their friends from wrestling rings, speeding trucks, and suspended platforms" with "doughy ragdoll physics and horrific environmental hazards." We've previewed this one a bit before, and it became an instant favorite.</p>

<p>We'll also be running <em><a href="http://pmpygame.com/">Push Me Pull You</a></em>, House House's "2v2 sports game about friendship and wrestling" where connected snake-y worm-y contestants "love each other, work together, communicate and coordinate" as they use their shared body to "wrap, writhe, and wrestle the ball into your half of the court."</p>

<p>And finally, we'll be showing <em><a href="http://rustymoyher.com/astroduel/">Astro Duel</a></em>, the competitive multiplayer tabletop game from Austin's own Rusty Moyher, where 2 to 4 players "blast each other using asteroid-style ships", in fast-paced rounds "inspired by endless nights of <em>Super Bomberman</em>.</p>
<p>All three games will be run in tournament play during this year's <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a>, so come join us as we drink, play and get ready to better face your competition, <strong>Thursday, September 4th, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>!
