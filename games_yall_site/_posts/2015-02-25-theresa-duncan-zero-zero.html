<p>Want to get the first look at a long-lost but newly preserved videogame classic? Join us <strong>Thursday, March 5th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin’s <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> as JUEGOS RANCHEROS looks back fondly on the wistful wonder of being a kid again with <em>Zero Zero </em>(1997) by the late Theresa Duncan, alongside two games by Nina Freeman that serve perfectly as contemporary counterparts.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, filmmaker and game designer Theresa Duncan did something pretty revolutionary: she helped create some of the first deeply smart and engaging CD-ROM games for girls. Her point-and-click adventure games were funny and surreal, recalling influences such as <em>Pee-Wee’s Playhouse, </em>while simultaneously incorporating bits of poetry, philosophy, and history. While Duncan’s games were widely acclaimed and innovative for the time, they slowly fell into relative obscurity.</p>

<p>In December 2014, the NYC-based digital art nonprofit <a href="http://rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome</a> successfully <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/710593842/theresa-duncan-cd-roms-visionary-videogames-for-gi?ref=hero_thanks" target="_blank">raised funds through Kickstarter</a> to preserve Duncan’s three games—<em>Chop Suey</em> (1995), <em>Smarty</em> (1996), and <em>Zero Zero</em> (1997)—with the goal of making them playable online for free later this year. JUEGOS RANCHEROS is pleased to present <em>Zero Zero</em> to the public in advance of Rhizome’s exhibition of the games in New York City.</p>

<p><em>Zero Zero </em>is set in Paris on the last night of 1899. Pinkée, the game’s young protagonist, delivers firewood to neighborhood shops while asking the eccentric grown-ups she encounters what they think the future will be like. Their responses are strange and surreal, offering a poignant commentary on 20<sup>th</sup>-century history and technology. Join us and be among the few to have played <em>Zero Zero </em>in the 21<sup>st</sup> century!</p>

<p>In addition to Duncan's work, we’ll also be showing two games from <a href="http://ninasays.so" target="_blank">Nina Freeman</a>: <em><a href="http://ninasays.so/spacedad/">Space Dad</a> </em> -- originally created for and <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/350/news/greetings-from-the-space-cowboy-arcade/">presented at our Space Cowboy Arcade</a> -- and 2015 IGF finalist <em><a href="http://ninasays.so/howdoyoudoit/">how do you Do it?</a> </em>Like Duncan, Freeman and her collaborators create games that touch on funny and poignant moments of being a young girl.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-397 size-large" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/sp.jpg" alt="sp" width="590" /></p>
<p>All the games will be playable <strong>Thursday, March 5th, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
