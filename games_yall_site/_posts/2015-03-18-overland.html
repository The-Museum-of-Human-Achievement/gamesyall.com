<p><strong>[NOTE: because of scheduling conflicts, this JUEGOS RANCHEROS show will take place <em>Wednesday, April 1st</em> instead of our usual Thursday night! We'll be back to the regular Thursday shows in May! We promise this is not an April Fools joke!]</strong></p>
<p>Love the likes of <em>X-COM, Oregon Trail</em> and roadtrips across a ruined American landscape? Then join us <strong>Wednesday, April 1st, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents the local debut of <em><a href="http://overland-game.com/">Overland</a></em>, the forthcoming tactical survival game from Austin's own <a href="http://finji.co/">Finji</a>.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/791848140896382/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>

<p>Just back from a critically acclaimed first showing at San Francisco's Game Developers Conference, Finji will be giving Austin an early opportunity to play the game, in which "players scavenge fuel and other supplies as they head directly into the heart of a cataclysm" which has produced "a hardly-recognizable America." </p>

<p>As part of the event, members of the development team -- which include Austin locals Adam Saltsman, Shay Pierce & Jocelyn Reyes, in addition to LA's Heather Penn -- will give a short presentation on both the influences & design goals of the game, in advance of its desktop/tablet release later this year.</p>
<p><em>Overland</em> will be playable <strong>Wednesday, April 1st, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
