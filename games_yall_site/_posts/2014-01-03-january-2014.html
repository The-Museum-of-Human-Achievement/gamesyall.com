<p>Every month, as part of <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/category/events/">the regular monthly meetings</a> of <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">JUEGOS RANCHEROS</a>, we do a very casual & chatty rundown of the ten or so games from the previous month for the audience, to give people -- especially those curious onlookers from outside the indie community itself -- a look at what they may have missed. The featured games are both local and global, and both indie and, on occasion, a bit-bigger-budget -- what binds them together is simply that they're all amazing.</p>
<p>In keeping with the tongue-in-tobacco-packed-cheek tone, we call these run-downs <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/category/a-fistful-of-indies">A Fistful of Indies</a>, which are presented here for your reference, each fully annotated & linked up for your pleasure.</p>

<h2>No Brakes Valet</h2>
<p>Developer: Captain Games | Platform: iPhone/iPad | Get it: <a href="http://ptrlvn.us/nobrakesvalet">App Store</a></p>
<p>"...the latest from frequent Fantastic Arcade visitor & <em>Enviro-Bear</em> creator, this has been out on Ouya for a bit now, but has just been released as an expanded iOS version that has — amongst other things — a same-device multiplayer mode, which makes this easily the new definitive version...."</p>

<h2>Titan Souls</h2>
<p>Developer: Mark Foster, David Fenn, Andrew Gleeson | Platform: Web/Windows | Get it: <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=7984">Here</a></p>
<p>"...next up are a few games from the most recent Ludum Dare competition, starting with this one, a super atmospheric tiny action game that draws a lot of inspiration from games like <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>. It’s a touch TOO hard, but is a very solid accomplishment for a 3-day game jam."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos027.009.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Go Long!!</h2>
<p>Developer: Andrew Brophy | Platform: Windows | Get it: <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=1240">Here</a></p>
<p>"... my favorite game from this year’s Ludum Dare, another tiny game that is, in a sense, a sports game, but is more about the <em>Parappa</em>-esque inner monologue of this would-be child sports star, psyching himself up for his big performance. It’s super ridiculous and basically totally pointless, but also kind of one of the funniest games i’ve played in a while."</p>

<h2>Become A Great Artist In Just 10 Seconds</h2>
<p>Developer: Andi Mcc & Michael Brough | Platform: Windows/Mac | Get it: <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/comment-page-1/?action=preview&uid=4987">Here</a></p>
<p>"...somewhat a parody of <em>Art Academy</em>-type games where you’re given basically zero time at all to replicate or create a work of 2D art, all of which ends up looking like what you see on the left here & all of which is saved out and sharable. This game has come up again this month because someone’s <a href="https://twitter.com/greatartbot">started a twitter bot</a> that generates and shares pieces of art 4 times a day — the whole thing’s a super interesting little statement."</p>

<h2>TRIHAYWBFRFYH</h2>
<p>Developer: Connor Sherlock | Platform: Windows/Mac | Get it: <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/other/trihaywbfrfyh/20342/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...'The Rapture Is Here and You Will Be Forcibly Removed from Your Home' is a 'just-walking' type game loosely based on a number of HP Lovecraft stories, which gives you exactly 20 minutes to explore a dead landscape as this unknowable terrifying darkness spreads across the sky — even with nothing much to do in the world, as a little tone-poem type experiment, it’s super interesting and effecting..."</p>

<h2>The Room Two</h2>
<p>Developer: Fireproof Games | Platform: iPad | Get it: <a href="http://ptrlvn.us/theroomtwo">App Store</a></p>
<p>"...I came sort of late to these games, but totally understand why they became instant hits — the production values & atmosphere are through the roof for what is essentially a series of little puzzle boxes to poke at & snap open. Both of these (including <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-room/id552039496?mt=8">the original</a>) are well worth picking up if you haven’t already."</p>

<h2>Longest Night</h2>
<p>Developer: Infinite Ammo & Scott Benson | Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux | Get it: <a href="http://www.nightinthewoods.com/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...the first little postcard type experience of the upcoming adventure <em>Night In The Woods</em>, the gist here is that you’re tracing out constellations in the sky & listening to the campfire conversations of the game’s main characters, and serves as a really beautiful little introduction to the world that they’re building..."</p>

<h2>Ernesto</h2>
<p>Developer: Daniel Benmergui | Platform: Web | Play it: <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/danielben/ernesto-a-quick-rpg">Here</a></p>
<p>"...a super tiny but really mechanically interesting take on dungeon crawlers where you’re tracing out your path from entrance-to-exit through this randomized field of tokens, and, crucially, you can backtrack and re-route yourself at any time. This is still being tweaked & reworked even as we speak, but is already super worth your time...."</p>

<h2>Cubic Space</h2>
<p>Developer: Adam Saltsman & Dose One | Platform: Web | Play it: <a href="http://adamatomic.com/cubic/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...another similarly tiny but insanely replayable sci-fi puzzle game all based on randomized dice that have you fighting through six sectors of alien invaders by smart use of your ship’s lasers and shields. It’s a really beautiful balance of strategy & randomness & was instantly one of my favorite games of last year..."</p>

<h2>Samurai Gunn</h2>
<p>Developer: Teknopants | Platform: Windows | Get it: <a href="http://samuraigunn.com">Here</a></p>
<p>"...one of the most exhilarating and stylish multiplayer games in recent memory & a game that literally makes you feel cool to play."</p>
