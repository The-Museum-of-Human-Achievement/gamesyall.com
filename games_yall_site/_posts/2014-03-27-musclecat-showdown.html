<p>Bummed out that you missed the debut of the ultimate game of competitive feline poise & grace? Then join us <strong>next Thursday, April 3rd, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents <em>Musclecat Showdown</em>, a new game from <a href="http://majorbueno.tumblr.com/">Major Bueno</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOG_UtLxh58">Bee and Puppycat</a> creator <a href="http://natazilla.tumblr.com/">Natasha Allegri</a>!</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/479125732216031">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p><em>Musclecat Showdown</em> was originally conceived & devised for <a href="http://thatvenuspatrolwildrumpusparty.com/">That Venus Patrol Wild Rumpus Party</a> at this year's Game Developers Conference -- which went down barely a week or so ago -- and ended up being so amazing that we're ready for it to begin its world-tour, starting right here in Austin!</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In it -- as captured above by David '<a href="https://twitter.com/candyham">CandyHam</a>' Vileta -- both players act as playground-conflict mediators between two rival schoolchildren, who settle their score by having an afterschool house-pet pose-off. </p>
<p>In phase one, you'll get pumped in your respective full-length mirrors, and then meet on the field for the showdown itself! Follow your owner's directions or get squirted with spray-bottles! Do them proud and find out who is the real ultimate musclecat!</p>
<p>Doors will be open <strong>Thursday, April 3rd, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, play, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
