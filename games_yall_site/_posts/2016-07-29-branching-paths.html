<p>Want to get the first, best look at what's happening in indie games around Japan? Then be sure to join us <strong>Thursday, August 4th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a free, all-ages screening of <a href="http://branchingpaths.jp/">Branching Paths</a>, the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sale/branchingpaths/">just-released</a> documentary about the burgeoning games community rising up in Tokyo and Kyoto.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/674811402683021/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>The documentary was directed by <a href="https://twitter.com/katsudon45">Anne Ferrero</a>, a Paris transplant who is also behind <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3zoY9LapZERsN7caDKqz0w/videos">Toco Toco TV</a>, a YouTube/broadcast show that serves as a fascinating deep dive into the broader Tokyo creative community (games fans will want to be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD25QKh6mGA">watch her recent episode</a> with <em>Deadly Premonition</em> & <em>D4</em> creator Swery 65, one of Japan's top cult/auteur game directors).</p>

<p>For Branching Paths, she's taken all of that curiosity and eye for beautiful filmwork and cast her lens on the two-year rise of indie game dev in Japan from 2013-2015.</p>
<p>Featured developers include a number of familiar faces, most notably Ojiro '<a href="https://twitter.com/moppin_">Moppin</a>' Fumoto (as well as occasional creative partner & incredible artist Momo '<a href="https://twitter.com/nemk_">nemk</a>' Murakami), whose work on <em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/360740/">Downwell</a></em> is perfectly encapsulated in that timeline from his first prototypes to the release of the game and its nomination in the Independent Games Festival.</p>

<p>You'll also see: <em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/105800/">PixelJunk Eden</a></em> creator Baiyon (another familiar face to long-time Fantastic Arcade-goers), <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em> creator gone-indie IGA, and <em>Mega Man</em> creator Keiji Inafune, as well as a number of Western developers who have settled in Japan, like <a href="http://17-bit.com/">17-Bit</a>'s Jake Kazdal, <em><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/Oquonie">Oquonie</a></em> developers Devine Lu Linvega & Rekka Bellum, <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/883/events/pico-8/">Pico-8</a> creator Joseph White, and <em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/">Papers, Please</a></em> creator Lucas Pope.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sale/branchingpaths/">CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE SHOW? GET IT ON STEAM NOW, ALONGSIDE A LAUNCH SALE ON MANY GAMES FEATURED IN THE FILM!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>Of special interest to JUEGOS RANCHEROS regulars is the documentary's focus on founding and flourishing of local communities of game developers that provide the lifeline and constant source of inspiration for fellow developers still not entirely convinced it's possible to make it as an indie.</p>
