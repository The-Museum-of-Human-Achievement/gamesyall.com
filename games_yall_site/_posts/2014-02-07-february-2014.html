<p>Every month, as part of <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/category/events/">the regular monthly meetings</a> of <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">JUEGOS RANCHEROS</a>, we do a very casual & chatty rundown of the ten or so games from the previous month for the audience, to give people -- especially those curious onlookers from outside the indie community itself -- a look at what they may have missed. The featured games are both local and global, and both indie and, on occasion, a bit-bigger-budget -- what binds them together is simply that they're all amazing.</p>
<p>In keeping with the tongue-in-tobacco-packed-cheek tone, we call these run-downs <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/category/a-fistful-of-indies">A Fistful of Indies</a>, which are presented here for your reference, each fully annotated & linked up for your pleasure.</p>

<h2>50 Short Games</h2>
<p>Developer: TheCatamites | Platform: PC | Get it: <a href="http://harmonyzone.org/50SHORTGAMES.html">Here</a></p>
<p>"...the first actual commercial release by the creator of games like <em>Murder Dog IV</em>, whose work is consistently surprising and delightful and entirely outside the realm of what you normally expect from games. We hope you’ll be able to support this, because we want to him to keep making new games forever...."</p>

<h2>Global Game Jam 2014</h2>
<p>Developer: Various | Platform: Various | Find them: <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games">Here</a></p>
<p>"...this past month saw the creation of approximately a billion new games for the Global Game Jam, a TON of which came out super amazing — I could’ve filled up the whole list with just game jam games.</p>
<p>I’ll link a bunch of the best of the games from here in Austin and everywhere else, but one I especially wanted to call out is this one you see here, called “<a href="http://ninasays.so/howdoyoudoit/">How Do You Do It</a>” by a New York City game jam team, which is probably my favorite of the bunch. It’s about exploring the mysteries of adult sex while your mom’s away — I instantly fell in love with it and think you probably will too."</p>

<h2>The Banner Saga</h2>
<p>Developer: Stoic | Platform: Windows/Mac | Get it: <a href="http://stoicstudio.com/buy-now/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...a game I actually first heard rumors and whispers about at one of these JUEGOS meetups a few years back, this ended as smart & tactical & well designed and unbelievably gorgeously illustrated as everyone was expecting, and is super worth spending some time with."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.004.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Octodad: Dadliest Catch</h2>
<p>Developer: Young Horses | Platform: Windows/Mac | Get it: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/224480/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...Like <em>Banner Saga</em>, this also turned out to be exactly what you were hoping it was going to be all along — a smart, funny and sort of tender game about always just barely holding it all together and keeping up appearances."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.005.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Jazzpunk</h2>
<p>Developer: Necrophone Games | Platform: Windows/Mac/Linux | Get it: <a href="http://necrophonegames.com/jazzpunk/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...best described as sort of 60’s bachelor pad spy fiction by way of Mad Magazine, it’s stylish but very much not sophisticated and it totally revels in that, and basically exists only to tell you a long steady stream of really dumb jokes you can’t help but laugh at."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.006.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Eliss Infinity</h2>
<p>Developer: Little--Eyes | Platform: iPhone/iPad | Get it: <a href="http://ptrlvn.us/elissinfinity">App Store</a></p>
<p>"...a re-release of a game that came out many years back, and was one of the first best artful games for the iPhone. It’s a super beautiful and super challenging action puzzle game about manipulating these colored planetary objects here, and the new release adds a brilliant endless mode as well as a bunch of other new balance tweaks and enhancements. Definitely pick this up whether or not you’ve ever tried the original <em>Eliss</em>."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.007.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Threes</h2>
<p>Developer: Asher Vollmer, Greg Wohlwend, and Jimmy Hinson | Platform: iPhone/iPad | Get it: <a href="http://ptrlvn.us/threes">Here</a></p>
<p>"...a super simple idea executed really beautifully, this has become a pretty constant companion — alongside <em>Eliss Infinity</em> it’s some of the best work the iPhone’s seen in a while..."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.008.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Pale Machine</h2>
<p>Developer: Ben Esposito & Bo-En | Platform: Web | Play it: <a href="http://www.bo-en.info/URLpalemachine.html">Here</a></p>
<p>"... a collection of tiny scenes timed to the track by musician Bo-En which all have one simple discrete purpose and interaction, which add up to an amazingly compelling experience. Ben has been pretty effortlessly killing it lately with everything he’s released, and this one is no exception..."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.009.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Broken Age</h2>
<p>Developer: Double Fine | Platform: PC/Mac/Linux | Get it: <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/232790/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...cuts out a ton of the frustration you may have felt at older point and clicks, but stays just on the right side of not-<em>too</em> streamlined, the 3D rendered 2D art is crazy beautiful, and the voice work is perfect. I devoured this in a single night and loved every minute...."</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/juegos028.010.jpg" alt="" title="juegos018.006" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82502" /></p>
<h2>Nidhogg</h2>
<p>Developer: Messhof | Platform: Windows | Get it: <a href="http://www.nidhogggame.com/">Here</a></p>
<p>"...the clarity of the fights, the new Daedelus music, and the unexpected slapsticky humor of the tug-of-war combat make it one of the best two player games ever made — it’s more or less the perfect expression of what it wants to be. Of all the games I’ve showed here tonight, you definitely need to experience this one."</p>
