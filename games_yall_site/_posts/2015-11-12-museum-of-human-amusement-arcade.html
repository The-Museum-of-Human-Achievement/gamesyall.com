<p>Austin indie & experimental game lovers rejoice: JUEGOS RANCHEROS is proud to present the opening of The Museum of Human Amusement, an arcade space we've built from scratch, debuting <strong><em>Saturday, November 14th at 11am</em></strong> at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/3600+LYONS+RD+AUSTIN,+TX/@30.2614014,-97.6995698,19.84z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1f233d7b9c9bc171">3600 Lyons Rd</a>, as part of the <a href="http://east.bigmedium.org/">East Austin Studio Tours</a>!</p>
<p>The Museum of Human Amusement is was created in partnership with Austin's esteemed art & event space <a href="http://themuseumofhumanachievement.com/">The Museum of Human Achievement</a>, and spearheaded by our own Rachel '<a href="https://twitter.com/partytimehxlnt">Party Time! Hexcellent!</a>' Weil. </p>
<p>For its <a href="http://east.bigmedium.org/">EAST</a> debut, the space will be in operation November 14th & 15th from 11am-6pm, and again November 21st & 22nd at the same time. </p>

<p>The extended JUEGOS family has spent nights & weekends over the past few weeks finishing out the space from inauspicious warehouse beginnings into something pretty special, so we hope you'll all join us there throughout November!</p>

<p>What will you be able to find there? For starters, the arcade will be home to all of the mini arcade cabinets we debuted at Fantastic Arcade, which you can <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/455/news/fantastic-arcade-humble-bundle/">see more details of here</a>. </p>
<p>The space will also include its own concession stand, selling T-shirts, buttons, stickers & more from both JUEGOS RANCHEROS and a number of associated developers & artists from around Austin. </p>
<p>Below you can find a few more progress shots as we built the arcade. There's still a ton to do before Saturday, but come celebrate the opening <strong><em>Saturday, November 14th from 11am to 6pm</em></strong> at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/3600+LYONS+RD+AUSTIN,+TX/@30.2614014,-97.6995698,19.84z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x1f233d7b9c9bc171">3600 Lyons Rd, Austin TX</a> -- just steps away from <a href="http://bluegenieart.com/">Blue Genie Art Industries</a> & <a href="http://www.sa-ten.com/">Sa-Ten Coffee</a>.</p>
<p>After <a href="http://east.bigmedium.org/">EAST</a> has drawn to a close, we'll still have the space available for future events -- keep checking back here to see what we're doing with the space next!</p>
