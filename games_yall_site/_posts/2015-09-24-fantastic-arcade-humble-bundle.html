<h2>WHEELS OF AURELIA</h2>
<p><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/wheels-of-aurelia"><em>Wheels of Aurelia</em></a> is a narrative road trip game set in the roaring Italian 70s. Half racing game, half interactive fiction, it tells the story of Lella, a restless woman driving on the roads of the western coast of Italy, the famous Via Aurelia. </p>
<p><em>Wheels of Aurelia</em> was created by Santa Ragione, the team behind former Fantastic Arcade fan faves like <em>Mirrormoon EP, FOTONICA</em> and <em>VideoHeroeS</em>.</p>

<h2>HELLMOUTH</h2>
<p><em><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/hellmouth">Hellmouth</a></em> is a competitive cooking game where players collect ingredients from a hellish death course and cook it to perfection to be fed to Satan. </p>
<p>The game is a collaboration between Ivan Safrin, Bobo Dai Do, and Thu Tran, Fantastic Arcade 2014’s BARFCADE host & best known as the host of the still-incredible IFC TV show <a href="http://www.ifc.com/shows/food-party">Food Party</a>. </p>

<h2>RISKY BISON</h2>
<p><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/risky-bison"><em>Risky Bison</em></a> is a frantic game about securing the financial future of a herd of buffaloes, from the creator of <em>Desert Golfing</em> & the early Fantastic Arcade favorite, <em>Enviro Bear 2000</em>. </p>
<p>Sell insurance on the high plains! Fight the law! Collect unusual cacti!</p>

<h2>HOKY</h2>
<p>Remember <em><a href="http://www.adventuretimegamejam.com/submissions/44-adventure-minute">TENNNES</a></em>? Meet its newest companion game, <a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/hoky"><em>HOKY</em></a>: arcade action on ice, for up two 4 players, from JW Nijmin & Kitty Calis. Separately, the two helped bring you <em>Nuclear Throne</em> and <em>Action Henk</em>, and together they won Fantastic Arcade’s first Gamemaking Frenzy competition with their Adventure Time inspired entry, <em><a href="http://www.adventuretimegamejam.com/submissions/44-adventure-minute">Adventure Minute</a></em>.</p>
<p>A non-traditional take on the classic sport of hockey, <em>HOKY</em> bends the rules and intentionally avoids deep knowledge of the source material. Ignorance or a fresh perspective? There's only one way to find out! Up to four players grab their sticks and slide onto the ice, cheered on by dynamic audience AI and their personal lust for sports.</p>

<h2>CRAP! NO ONE LOVES ME</h2>
<blockquote><p>“My morning ritual is pretty simple: I check my phone and scream. Then I crawl into my coffin, it’s all warmed up... let’s go for a ride.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/crap-no-one-loves-me">CRAP! No One Loves Me</a></em> is a daily affirmation & multiplayer coffin bobsledding journey into the afterlife, which comes to you from Arcane Kids, the creators of <em>Zineth, Perfect Stride</em> and, most recently, the amazing and indescribable <em><a href="http://hedgehog.exposed/">Sonic Dreams Collection</a></em>.</p>
<p>Meet fellow teens at the Vape Shop. Pick a sick custom coffin. Boost into purgatory. Will the Baroness take pity on your lonely no-followers having soul, or will she grind your bones into dust? Is there a difference? Is there such a thing as relief?</p>

<h2>ALEA</h2>
<p><em><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/alea">Alea</a></em> is a hiking simulator & experience of infinity, and a reminder of the endless light and dark currently occurring in all directions, at all times. It was co-created by Cale Bradbury, musician Calia Thompson-Hannant, and Paloma Dawkins, best known for her KO-OP Mode debut game, <em>Gardenarium</em>.</p>
<p>It's a psychedelic game that's like a hiking or forest simulator combined with <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em> or <em>Guitar Hero</em>, but all you need is a keyboard and sunglasses. Your goal is to zen out till the end of the track without missing a beat, while making sure to listen and watch the plants as they communicate to you. Inspired by hiking with friends that suck at nature, don't rush to the end of the track. It's just a game.</p>
