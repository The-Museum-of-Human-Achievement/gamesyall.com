<p>Want to play the next hit game by the designers that brought you super stylish successes CANABALT and SOLIPSKIER before anyone else? Then join us this <strong>Sunday, November 4th, at 4PM</strong> for our sixteenth edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball, where we'll be presenting the Texas premiere of <a href="http://playhundreds.com/">HUNDREDS</a>, the upcoming iPhone and iPad game from designers <a href="http://aeiowu.com/">Greg Wohlwend</a> (SOLIPSKIER, GASKETBALL), Austin's own <a href="http://semisecretsoftware.com">Semi Secret</a> (WURDLE, CANABALT, GRAVITY HOOK) and ambient electronic musician Scott Morgan, aka <a href="http://loscil.bandcamp.com/">Loscil</a>.</p>

<p>Semi Secret describe the game as "an abstract, minimalist, arcade-puzzle game designed specifically for touch screens featuring 100 carefully crafted levels" which "teaches a variety of increasing complex gameplay ideas without tutorials, tells a strange story in an unconventional way, and allows players to play at their own pace, cooperatively or solitaire."</p>

<p>I describe it as one of the best iPad games I've played in ages, which instantly ensnares you into its gorgeously & clinically austere universe -- every single person I've seen that's laid just a tentative finger on it has immediately fallen down its rabbit hole and not emerged for hours. Now it's your chance to find out why! </p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, November 4th, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come early to get a head-start on unravelling the mystery of HUNDREDS, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
