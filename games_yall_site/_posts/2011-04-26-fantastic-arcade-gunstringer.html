<p>And so here's the real reason JUEGOS RANCHEROS is <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/8/news/story-of-the-juegos-rancheros/">coming together now</a>: several weeks back we were approached by none less than the <a href="http://www.originalalamo.com/">Alamo Drafthouse</a> (aka basically the best movie theater in the entire world) to host a new monthly event at their spin-off lounge <a href="http://www.thehighball.com/">The Highball</a>. The event would be a year-round continuation of <a href="http://www.fantasticfest.com/arcade/">Fantastic Arcade</a> -- the games festival they debuted last year alongside their renowned <a href="http://www.fantasticfest.com/">Fantastic Fest film festival</a>. Obviously we agreed, and so, we kick this whole thing off at The Highball <strong>this Sunday, May 1st, from 4-6:30pm</strong>. </p>

<p>For our first event, we'll be bringing in Twisted Pixel's upcoming Xbox 360/Kinect game <a href="http://www.thegunstringer.com/">THE GUNSTRINGER</a>. If you haven't yet seen it, GUNSTRINGER is an un-dead, old-west puppet-theater shooter (a combination of words which should be enough to get you excited), and is not just Austin-grown, but Austin-proud. Apart from that reference to Torchy's Tacos you weren't sure if you just correctly heard, <a href="http://twistedpixelgames.com/">Twisted Pixel</a> have also -- in a brilliant fourth-wall-shattering self-referential twist -- put Austinite fans in the game as the audience that watches and reacts to your puppet performance. You'll get to see that in action this Sunday: the first public playable demo of the game since March. </p>

<p>Aside from GUNSTRINGER, we'll also have a lot of other local game developers & demos on hand, not least Bob Sabiston of <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/Flat_Black_Films/Home.html">Flat Black Films</a> -- creator of the animation software that powered both <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/Flat_Black_Films/Films/Pages/Waking_Life.html">WAKING LIFE</a> & <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/Flat_Black_Films/Films/Pages/A_Scanner_Darkly.html">A SCANNER DARKLY</a> -- showing off his just-released downloadable Nintendo DS animation software package <a href="http://www.inchwormanimation.com/">INCHWORM</a>, and there just might be some unreleased, upcoming Nintendo 3DS* games making the rounds as well...?</p>
<p>So let's see how this all goes down:<strong> Sunday, May 1st, 4-6:30PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come hang out, enjoy <a href="http://www.thehighball.com/events/fantastic-arcade-happy-hour-%E2%80%A2-4pm/">the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials</a>, and celebrate the people taking games in directions you never thought possible. <strong>On Facebook? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=197929073581717">RSVP by clicking here</a> (and invite your friends!) so we can get an idea of how many people to expect!</strong></p>
<p>[*PS: if you've already got a 3DS: bring it! We're all more or less starved for some StreetPasses!]</p>
