<p>JUEGOS RANCHEROS is pleased to announce that we have <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/65297-arcade-of-anything">been awarded a new grant</a> from the Austin chapter of the Awesome Foundation, for our newly-established artist residency program, the <strong>arcade of anything</strong>.  </p>
<p>Operating through local chapters across the globe, <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org">The Awesome Foundation</a> "advances the interest of awesome in the universe" with $1000 micro-grants, given monthly on a no-strings-attached basis to "people and groups working on awesome projects."</p>
<p><strong>Arcade of anything</strong> residencies provide artists a month-long opportunity to develop experimental digital games, art, and other interactive works. <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/residencies/">The program</a> places a stronger emphasis on strange and wonderful projects which facilitate creative growth, unexpected collaborations, and community engagement, rather than commercially-viable products or finished works.</p>

<p>The <strong>arcade of anything</strong> program most recently debuted <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1187/events/association-of-electron-dreamers/">The Association of Electron Dreamers</a> (above), an interactive installation created by local Austin artists Audrey Moon and Jocelyn Reyes.</p>
<p>JUEGOS RANCHEROS is currently coordinating with our next <strong>arcade of anything</strong> resident artist, whose work will be shown at an opening night exhibition on September 30th, 2016, immediately following this year's <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com">Fantastic Arcade</a>.</p>
