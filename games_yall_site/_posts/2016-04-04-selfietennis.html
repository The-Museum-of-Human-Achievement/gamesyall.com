<p><a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/716644149928321024">Freshly announced</a> as the first VR game published by Austin's own <a href="http://www.devolverdigital.com/">Devolver Digital</a>, <em>#SelfieTennis</em> more or less instantly became one of our favorite things to do with the Vive. </p>

<p>It's the <em>Wii Sports</em>/<em>Mario Tennis</em> virtual reality needed: a super colorful, super simple & super accessible sports game, where the catch is that you're always playing against yourself.</p>
<p>Lob a ball across the net & you're instantly transported to the opposite side of the court, where you can return your own serve and keep the ball in play as long as you can, or simply give in to your own frustration and find your own fun by pinging your ball against the heads of the court's deliriously cheerful on-lookers.</p>

<p>Devolver will be providing some of the night's best players with keys for the game (which is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/392190/">currently on sale on Steam</a>!) so you can continue your quest for mastery back home. With some luck, we may even have a quick hello from one of the VRUnicorns themselves, and ample opportunities to tweet out a gif of yourself playing via the newly-added in-game selfie stick. </p>
