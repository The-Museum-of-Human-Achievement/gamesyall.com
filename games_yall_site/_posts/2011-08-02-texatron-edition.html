<p>Did the home console kill off the arcade? Is the idea of gathering in a public space to play games together an outmoded concept of the early 80s? <strong>This Sunday, August 7th, at 4PM</strong>, our fourth edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball will prove those ideas wrong and be the launching point for the TEXATRON initiative to bring independent game arcade machines to Austin.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=127608297332953">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>What began in Toronto with <a href="http://handeyesociety.com/torontron/">the Torontron</a> soon spread across the Great White North to Winnipeg with <a href="http://winnitron.ca/">the Winnitron</a>, an arcade cabinet built from the ground-up to bring independent games both local and global to the rest of the world, with Winnitron machines soon popping up in such far flung locations as the Netherlands, New Zealand, New York and Australia. </p>
<p>In attendance this Sunday -- all the way from Winnipeg -- will be Alec Holowka of <a href="http://infiniteammo.ca/">Infinite Ammo</a>, developer of indie hits like <a href="http://www.bit-blot.com/aquaria/">AQUARIA</a>, <a href="http://blurst.com/paper-moon/">PAPER MOON</a> and the upcoming <a href="http://infiniteammo.ca/blog/tag/marian/">MARIAN</a>, and co-founder of the Winnitron project, to tell us more about what the Winnitron is, how it works, and how it's changing the way we experience indie games across the world.</p>

<p>Following that, we'll be giving Austin its first chance to play <a href="http://winnitron.ca/games/">the Winnitron's selection of games</a>, including cult successes like Messhof's brilliant swordfighter <a href="http://messhof.com/nidhogg/">NIDHOGG</a> and special exclusive two-player versions of games like Vlambeer's <a href="http://www.supercratebox.com/">SUPER CRATE BOX</a> and our own Adam Saltsman's <a href="http://adamatomic.com/canabalt/">CANABALT</a>. </p>
<p>But more importantly, we'll be talking more about our long-time goals to bring the Winnitron to Austin as the TEXATRON -- a series of arcade cabinets set up around our own fair city showcasing the best indie games from around town and around the world.  </p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, August 7th, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come hang out, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games (and cartoons)!</p>
<p>[*PS: Hey everyone! As usual, bring your 3DS again! We're doing awesome with these StreetPasses!]</p>
