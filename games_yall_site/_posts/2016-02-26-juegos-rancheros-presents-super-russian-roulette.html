<p>Dust off your spurs and your Zapper, kids--we're going back to the future with an all-new game for the NES! This Thursday, March 3 at 7:00 PM, mosey on over to the North Door to settle the score with an 8-bit trash-talkin' cowboy as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents SUPER RUSSIAN ROULETTE.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/600992276722296/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>Andrew Reitano (NYC) is a hardware hacker, programmer, and game designer who blew us all away last year with his in-progress NES game, Super Russian Roulette. In it, up to three players play Russian Roulette against an on-screen cowboy using the NES Zapper light gun. (Remember Duck Hunt?) Thanks to backers of his ongoing <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batslyadams/super-russian-roulette-a-new-party-game-for-the-ne">Kickstarter campaign for the project</a>, Super Russian Roulette is now being produced in a limited run of real NES cartridges! </p>
<p>To round out the evening with more retro goodness, JUEGOS RANCHEROS's resident 8-bit gamemaker Rachel Weil will be showing off her most recent NES game: Electronic Sweet-N-Fun Fortune Teller. What's your BFF really thinking? Who has a crush on you? Let this cute NES game take a shot at the answers!</p>
<p>And finally, JUEGOS RANCHEROS is pleased to announce the official launch party of its experimental arcade on Friday, March 4, in collaboration with the Museum of Human Acheivement. Reitano will join us with Super Russian Roulette and some of his original Sega Genesis projection art! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1054850967890322/">RSVP for the party here</a>! </p>
<p>Super Russian Roulette and Electronic Sweet-N-Fun Fortune Teller will be playable <strong>Thursday, March 3, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>. The show is free, all ages, and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play, and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
