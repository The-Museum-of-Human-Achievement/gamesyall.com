<p>Spring has sprung, and JUEGOS RANCHEROS has returned! So join us <strong>Thursday, April 6, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> — as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a  mix of new & never before seen games, including <em><a href="http://vignettesga.me/">Vignettes</a></em>.</p>
<p>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/200059113817470/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</p>
<p>Not seen since the 2015 installment of Fantastic Arcade, <em>Vignettes</em> is a delightful puzzle-box of a game and, says the developers, a "kaleidoscope of different moods and settings", which is officially due to be released soon on iOS and Android. Fans of <em>GNOG</em> and the work of Vectorpark (like his previously-showcased <em><a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/370/events/metamorphabet/">Metamorphabet</a></em>) will not want to miss this one!</p>

<p><em>Vignettes</em> is being created by Klondike members Pol Clarissou (who you'll remember from last year's <em><a href="https://polclarissou.itch.io/orchids-to-dusk">Orchids to Dusk</a></em>) and Armel Gibson (who also brought <em><a href="http://fantasticfest.com/games/oases">Oases</a></em> to Fantastic Arcade), with help from <em><a href="http://lootrascals.com/">Loot Rascal</a></em>'s Pat Ashe and music by none less than <a href="https://davidkanaga.bandcamp.com/">David Kanaga</a> — <em>Proteus</em> musician and creator of one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOugEcsHXDY">Fantastic Arcade 2016's most unforgettable games/performances</a>: the five-act dog opera, <em><a href="http://oikospiel.com/">Oikospiel Book I</a></em>.</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Vignettes</em> — its first showing in near-final form! — we'll be assembling even more games to be revealed at the show, and our usual "indie alley" lineup of games made by local developers!</p>
<p>The exhibition will begin <strong>Thursday, April 6, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>, with a short introduction at 8:00PM. The show is free, all ages, and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
