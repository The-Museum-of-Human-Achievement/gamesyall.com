<p>The Juegos Rancheros leadership was recently made aware of several concerns regarding Brandon Boyerâ€™s conduct in our community. As a first step toward addressing these claims, the leadership has voted unanimously to dismiss him from the Juegos Rancheros Board of Directors, effective immediately. While no final decision has been reached, we believe this is the best way forward while we continue to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>We are taking some additional steps to ensure the Juegos Rancheros community continues to thrive. We are revising our existing Safe Spaces Policy to provide more specific guidance on appropriate conduct and conflict resolution. We are also working to improve avenues for collecting anonymous feedback about community concerns and leading the formation of a response team to ensure that our policies are enforced promptly, safely, and fairly. Finally, we are taking this opportunity to grow and diversify the membership of our Board of Directors to ensure that our leadership accurately represents the diverse perspectives of our community.</p>
<p>The Juegos Rancheros Board of Directors deeply regrets that these additional provisions were not in place before we began to receive reports, and we sincerely apologize for the confusion, hurt, or distrust this caused for anyone in our community. We are committed to fostering a welcoming and safe environment, and the remedies outlined above are our next steps toward achieving this goal.</p>
<p>We will continue to provide updates regarding our code of conduct and conflict resolution. However, we also want to hear from you. Please <a href="mailto:juegosrancheros@gmail.com">let us know</a> if you are interested in providing peer review of our <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/safe-spaces/">Safe Spaces Policy</a>, participating in our response team, or joining the Juegos Rancheros Board of Directors. Thank you for your understanding in this time of difficult but necessary transition. We care deeply for our community and look forward to seeing you at the next Juegos Rancheros event.</p>
<p>The Juegos Rancheros Board of Directors<br />
