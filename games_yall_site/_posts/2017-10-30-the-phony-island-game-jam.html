<p>Step right up! This year's <a href="https://itch.io/jam/phony-island">Fantastic Arcade Gamemaking Frenzy</a> has officially begun! From now until <em><strong>Sunday, November 12th, at 11:59pm CST</strong></em> we are calling on developers from around the world to participate in our two-week game jam, <strong><em><a href="https://itch.io/jam/phony-island">Phony Island</a></em></strong>!</p>
<p>We are inviting you to create your best 2-player microgames in the style of alllllmost copyright-infringing carnival games, that juuuust manage to stay on the right side of the law <small>(<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/11041965@N02/15145799883">above photo credit</a>)</small>.</p>
<p><i><strong>TO ENTER THE JAM: </strong></i></p>
<p>- Your game must be a head-to-head simultaneous two-player game. Your game must run on Windows (sorry!) and use WASD + SPACE for player one and ARROW-KEYS + ENTER for player two as input in order to be considered for inclusion in the Phony Island "cabinet." </p>
<p>- It must have a short duration, 30 seconds or less, resulting in a WIN or LOSE for each player. (We'll be keeping score offstage.). </p>
<p>- After the match is over the game must QUIT AUTOMATICALLY. </p>
<p>- Your jam must reference this year's secret ingredient.</p>
<p><i><strong>THIS YEAR'S SECRET INGREDIENT IS:</strong></i></p>
<p>&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;​&#x1f39f;​&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;​&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;​THE TICKET&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;&#x1f39f;</p>
<p>Before ending your game, please award the winning player with an arbitrary number of tickets, which we will tally during our playthrough on November 19th. The player with the most amount of tickets will redeem them for a fabulous prize!</p>
<p>All of the submitted games will be compiled into a custom launcher and run as part of a live game-show-like event on the final night of this year's <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a>, at the festival's new home: Alamo Drafthouse's boardwalk carnival-esque bar, the <a href="http://barrelofunatx.com/">Barrel O Fun</a>. </p>
<p>From now until <strong><em>Sunday, November 12th, at 11:59pm CST</em></strong> you can submit your game at <a href="https://itch.io/jam/phony-island">itch.io's #phonyisland</a> jam site. We look forward to seeing your game!</p>
