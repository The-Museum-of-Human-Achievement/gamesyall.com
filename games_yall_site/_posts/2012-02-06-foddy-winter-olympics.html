<p>What does an Oxford bioethics teacher and a former member of Cut Copy (?!?) know about videogames? Come find out <strong>this Sunday, February 12th, at 4PM</strong>, at The Foddy Winter Olympics: our ninth edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball that will show you exactly why <a href="http://www.foddy.net/">Bennett Foddy</a>'s become one of indie gaming's most notable (and funniest!) cult-hit creators.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/173969086045450/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>

<p>A little background: it all started with <a href="http://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>, a free web game (later <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=y29zPuiufYk&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fqwop-for-ios%252Fid410319945%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">ported to the iPhone</a>) that took the button-mashing simplicity of 8-bit classics like TRACK & FIELD to its totally illogical polar extreme, giving you direct control of each muscle of your athlete's legs and asking you to learn how to walk all over again. A true viral hit, soon YouTube & Tumblr were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=qwop">full of people</a> attempting <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/qwop">to do just that</a>, as well as some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlgOodQnFS4">inspired cosplay</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/jpmoore/bill-qwopsby-cosby">the best animated Cosby-sweater-photo</a> of all time.</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Then came <a href="http://www.foddy.net/GIRP.html">GIRP</a>, which turned rock-climbing into a game of Twister for your keyboard, <a href="http://www.foddy.net/WinnervsLoser.html">WINNER VS LOSER</a>, a competitive, slapstick return to TRACK & FIELD for drunks, and, most recently, <a href="http://www.foddy.net/PoleRiders.html">POLERIDERS</a>, a two-player polo game played out using hyper-realistic vaulting-pole physics.</p>
<p>So, what will our Winter Olympics consist of?</p>

<p>First, the Texas debut of <a href="http://doougle.net/projects/mega-girp.html">MEGA GIRP</a>, a remix of the rock-climbing hit by Doug Wilson, the creator of JUEGOS-favorite <a href="http://gutefabrik.com/joust.html">JOHANN SEBASTIAN JOUST</a>. Played out on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/brandonnn/status/166028754693521409">four dance-mats laid out like a giant full-body keyboard</a>, MEGA GIRP turns those finger-Twister gymnastics into the real-life counterpart. Wear stretchy pants!</p>

<p>We'll also be debuting: multiplayer QWOP! -- a head-to-head version that sizes up just who the real muscle-manipulating champion really is. And we'll obviously also have lots and lots of pole-riding and winning versus losing: give all of them a try via the links above & get your fingers (and whole body) limbered up to take the championship!</p>

<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, February 12th, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come hang out, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
