<p>Hey everyone! JUEGOS co-founder Adam Saltsman here. It is with a potent mixture of relief and regret that we post this reminder that we are SKIPPING the regularly scheduled JUEGOS RANCHEROS meetup ND during October. </p>
<p>We are all taking a much-needed break after <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com">this year's uber-successful Fantastic Arcade event</a> (seen above), and will be returning with a great JR meetup at the usual time and place at the ND, Thursday, November 7th. We'll post more details about that in a few weeks!</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are also working on a bunch of administrative and organizational tasks within JR itself that will enable us to do more and better events going forward, and we'll be posting a bunch of information about that very soon too. </p>
<p>That's all for now! Have a great October. We'll have some cool good news and new plans to share very soon!</p>
