<p>Hey all, some short-notice awesome news: <strong>this Saturday, June 16th, from 8pm-9pm</strong>, JUEGOS RANCHEROS and Church of the Friendly Ghost are teaming up for a game night featuring everyone's favorite baroque slow-motion dueling game: <a href="http://gutefabrik.com/joust.html">JOHANN SEBASTIAN JOUST</a>! Best of all: the event is free!</p>
<p>The hour-long JOUST-a-thon will take place at <a href="http://thebeautybar.com/austin/">the Beauty Ballroom</a> from 8-9pm, as part of the <a href="http://thebeautyballroom.ticketfly.com/event/123519/">Dance Party</a> portion of Friendly Ghost's 2012 <a href="http://nmassfest.org/?page_id=333">New Media Art and Sound Summit</a>, which will also feature music by <a href="http://therealflyingturns.com/">Flying Turns</a>, <a href="http://nmassfest.org/?page_id=287">Hieroglyphic Being</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/WOOLFY/73593770841">Woolfy</a>, performance art by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Quick.Draw.Photo.Booth">Quick Draw Photobooth</a>, and visuals by <a href="http://www.macandcheez.com/">Stephen Hal Fishman</a> and JUEGOS's own <a href="http://www.partytimehexcellent.com">Party Time! Hexcellent!</a></p>

<p>Following JOUST, from 9-10pm, JUEGOS will also be showing <a href="http://distractionware.com/games/flash/hexagon/">HEXAGON</a>, the brilliant "27th century space-disco teen-laser-punk arcade hit" (that's how I describe it, anyway) by Terry Cavanagh, creator of indie favorite <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>. HEXAGON's easily one of the most instantly addictive and infinitely replayable games I've put my hands on this year -- get warmed up and ready to show us your skills on Saturday by <a href="http://distractionware.com/games/flash/hexagon/">playing it online here</a>! There's even a chance we'll be bringing along a version no one's played before...</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you <strong>Saturday, June 16th, from 8-10pm at the Beauty Ballroom</strong>, located at 2015 E. Riverside Dr! Remember: while the Dance Party itself is normally <a href="http://thebeautyballroom.ticketfly.com/event/123519/">$10 at the door</a>, if you come for JOUST & HEXAGON at 8pm, you can stay all night for free!</p>
