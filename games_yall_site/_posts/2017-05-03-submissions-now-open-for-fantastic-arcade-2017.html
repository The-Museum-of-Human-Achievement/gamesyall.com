<p>The 2017 edition of Fantastic Arcade will be taking place at Austin's <a href="https://drafthouse.com/austin/theater/mueller">Alamo Drafthouse Mueller</a>, the newest and swankiest of the theaters, from November 17th through the 19th. 3-day passes for the festival itself <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fantastic-arcade-2017-tickets-34182517831">are available now</a>, which includes a downloadable bundle of games premiering at the show!</p>

<p>Shortly after the August 13th deadline, the JUEGOS RANCHEROS board will begin the selection process to determine which games from among your submissions will be showcased during Fantastic Arcade. </p>
<p>All of the games selected will be accessible to both festival attendees and the general public, for free, in a casual atmosphere of camaraderie and love for games, at the Mueller theater's new Barrel O Fun event center (which you can see above).</p>
<p>If you’d like to submit a game, you can do so now by <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/submit/">accessing this form before August 13th</a>. We look forward to playing all of your submissions, and to seeing you all in November for this year’s Arcade!</p>
