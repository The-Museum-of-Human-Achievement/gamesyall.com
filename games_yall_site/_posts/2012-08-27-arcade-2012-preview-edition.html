<p>Headlining the event will be <a href="http://www.capybaragames.com/super-t-i-m-e-force/">SUPER TIME FORCE</a>, the ultra-amazing time-bending future-shooter from <a href="http://www.swordandsworcery.com/">#SWORCERY</a> & <a href="http://www.capybaragames.com/critter-crunch-psn/">CRITTER CRUNCH</a> creators <a href="http://www.capybaragames.com/">Capy</a>, which I'll let them explain here:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE YEAR: 198X</p>
<p>LOCATION: OUTER-SPACE / 4TH DIMENSION AKA TIME</p>
<p>THE PROBLEM: EVERYTHING’S GONE TO SHIT!</p>
<p>THE MISSION: FIX IT!</p>
<p>Super TIME Force is a rip-roarin’, run ‘n gun action game with a time-traveling twist that creates opportunities for both strategy and mayhem, or, “strayhem”. With an ingenious “time-rewinding” mechanic, STF takes the action to intense new peaks by allowing players to team up with their own past replays of a level in an utterly unique single-player co-op experience that sees all of your past-lives fighting together at once. It’s fun to play with yourself! You command the elite, time-travelling soldiers of the STF in their mission to make the world a more awesome place by jumping through time and messing with the history books. At every event the STF endeavours to undo, the evil Blounbots appear and attack, seemingly trying to undo their undoing. Still with us? Good! Who commands these filthy space robots? What is their agenda? And why do they hate freedom so much? Tune in, er... Play the game to find out!</p></blockquote>

<p>We'll also be running the latest version of <a href="http://superhexagon.com/">SUPER HEXAGON</a>, the game we've previously described as a "27th century space-disco teen-laser-punk arcade hit", created by <a href="http://distractionware.com/blog/">Terry Cavanagh</a>, best known for games like <a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>. This game's been stealing our time like no other over the past couple months, in a neverending string of 15-20 seconds at a time.</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And finally, we'll be showing off <a href="http://mcpixel.net/">MCPIXEL</a> by Sos, one of the best slapstick-comedy games we've ever played, where you're given 20 seconds to save the day in hundreds of precarious and stupid situations, and kicking the nearest person in the junk is always a legitimate & sometimes actually lucrative option.</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, September 2nd, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come early to get a head-start on your Fantastic Arcade 2012 experience, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
