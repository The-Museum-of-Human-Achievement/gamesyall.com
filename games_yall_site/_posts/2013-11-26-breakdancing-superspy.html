<p>You know him best as the designer behind games like <em><a href="http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/">Canabalt</a>, <a href="http://playhundreds.com/">Hundreds</a></em> and his Keita Takahashi collaboration <em><a href="http://blog.adamatomic.com/post/61425705146/alphabet-by-keita-takahashi-with-whom-i-was">A͈L͈P͈H͈A͈B͈E͈T͈</a></em>, but <strong>next Thursday, December 5th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, JUEGOS RANCHEROS will present <em>Breakdancing Superspy</em> -- a brand-new physical game being created by Austin's own <a href="http://adamatomic.com/">Adam Saltsman</a>. </p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/777019732325245/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>In the grand tradition of body-bending games previously featured at JUEGOS RANCHEROS & Fantastic Arcade like <em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8i_hkbUqGM">MEGA-GIRP</a></em> & <em>MEGA-A͈L͈P͈H͈A͈B͈E͈T͈</em>, Saltsman describes the game as "a race to be the fastest to complete an awkward obstacle course that resembles single-player Twister, drunken hopscotch, and/or a clumsy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment_(film)">Entrapment</a>-era Catherine Zeta-Jones." (see: below)</p>

<p>"Players will live out their wildest spy fantasies and," he adds, "tip over sometimes", in this "large-scale physical game powered by a tarp and a pair of projectors." </p>

<p>For those less limber or sure on their feet (particularly a few beers in) than Saltsman himself -- seen above lithely prototyping the game in his backyard -- we'll also be toting along a few more traditional games to fill out your evening, or feel free to just gawk at the tangled bodies making their first foray across <em>Superspy</em>'s playfield.</p>
