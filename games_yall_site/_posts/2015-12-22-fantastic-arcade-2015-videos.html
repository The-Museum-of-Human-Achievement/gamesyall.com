<p>Better late than never, we've just released video of nearly every session that took place at this year's Fantastic Arcade for your at-home perusal. Included in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0aFSDY8m29hfux0K8tiSeQL0ekEQ_ke">the full playlist above</a> are nearly 30 sessions by developers including Double Fine and Arcane Kids, and our usual selection of amazing tournaments like ROCKET LEAGUE and VIDEOBALL. </p>
<p><strong>[NOTE:</strong> a few of our live-streamed videos — including our <em>N++</em> tournament and <em>Wheels of Aurelia</em> developer commentary — have been automatically muted & otherwise blocked by both Twitch & YouTube Content ID systems. We're working to restore as much of these sessions as we're able to & host them where we can, as we have with Sam Barlow's <em>Her Story</em> session below!<strong>]</strong></p>
