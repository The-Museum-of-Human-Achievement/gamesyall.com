<p>We survived another <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a>! And after a long weekend recovering, we're here with archived video of nearly all the talks, tournaments, and other presentations given throughout the week of our seventh-annual festival.</p>
<p>All week long we'll be presenting a day-by-day breakdown of all of the videos, starting today with last Monday's talks. Below the fold you'll find full video covering HIDDEN FOLKS, Dutch indie collective Sokpop, BURRITO GALAXY 65 and WEST OF LOATHING. </p>
<p>You'll also find our preliminary tournament of MULTIBOWL, the rapid-fire head-to-head trip back through arcade and console history!</p>
