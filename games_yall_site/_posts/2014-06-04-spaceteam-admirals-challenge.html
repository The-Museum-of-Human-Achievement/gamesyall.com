<p><em><a href="http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/">Spaceteam</a></em> isn't just one of our favorite mobile games, it's one of the most enduringly engrossing, and so on <strong>Thursday, June 5th, at 7:00PM</strong>, Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> will be host to the first of a set of worldwide tournaments as we present the <em>Spaceteam</em> Admiral's Challenge.</p>

<p>First released in late 2012 and best described by its creators as a "cooperative shouting game", <em><a href="http://www.sleepingbeastgames.com/spaceteam/">Spaceteam</a></em> has been a local party and any-other-downtime mainstay since. And so when word came that creator Henry Smith would be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hengineer/spaceteam-admirals-club-relaunch">relaunching his campaign</a> to fund new games through the <a href="http://spaceteamadmiralsclub.com/teaser/"><em>Spaceteam</em> Admiral's Club</a> (after coming <em>just</em> shy of his <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hengineer/spaceteam-admirals-club">original Kickstarter goal</a>), we knew we wanted to officially take part.</p>
<p>And so, on Thursday we'll be hosting the first of <a href="http://spaceteamadmiralsclub.com/challenge">a series of <em>Spaceteam</em> tournaments</a> that will be happening from June 4th to July 5th, across dozens of worldwide locations that'll also include New York, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Melbourne, and Montreal. </p>

<p>Participants will be able to download <a href="http://ptrlvn.us/spaceteam">an updated tournament-ready version of <em>Spaceteam</em></a> that'll include new special achievements & in-game rewards for competitors, and physical prizes for the best <em>Spaceteam</em> captains of the night.</p>
<p>We'll have more information on how this is all going to work the night of, so come as a team or be prepared to form a crew the night of, but either way we hope to see you out on <strong>Thursday, June 5th, promptly at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, play, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
