<p>Hey developers! This is your annual warning that submissions for <a href="http://fantasticfest.com/">Fantastic Arcade 2016</a> will be closing in just two short weeks. If you would like your game to be considered for the festival, please <a href="https://drafthouse.wufoo.com/forms/fantastic-arcade-2016/">click here to submit it</a> before July 13th, at 11:59 PM Central Time. </p>
<p>We've <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">added a countdown timer on our main page</a> so you can keep track of when that is for you, but please don't wait until the last minute and risk missing the deadline! </p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://drafthouse.wufoo.com/forms/fantastic-arcade-2016/">CLICK HERE TO SUBMIT YOUR GAME!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>This year's Fantastic Arcade will take place at Austin’s South Lamar Alamo Drafthouse & Highball lounge, from <strong>September 26th through the 29th</strong>, during the second week of the <a href="http://fantasticfest.com/">Fantastic Fest film festival</a>.</p>

<p>After the July 13th deadline, <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/board/">the JUEGOS RANCHEROS board</a> will begin the selection process to determine which games from among your submissions will be showcased during Fantastic Arcade. All of the games selected will be accessible to both festival attendees and the general public, for free, in a casual atmosphere of camaraderie and love for games.</p>
<p>We look forward to playing all of your submissions, and especially to seeing you all in September for <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com">this year’s Arcade</a>!</p>
