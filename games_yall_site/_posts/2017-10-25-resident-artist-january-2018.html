<p>Run in partnership with <a href="http://themuseumofhumanachievement.com/">The Museum of Human Achievement</a> & Unlisted Projects, the residency program centers around our independent arcade space, the MUSEUM OF HUMAN AMUSEMENT. </p>
<p>In 2016, we debuted new work from <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1187/events/association-of-electron-dreamers/">Austin artists Audrey Moon & Jocelyn Reyes</a>, and <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1536/events/shifting-sand-lands/">NYC-based software developer & origami master Robby Kraft</a>. In 2017, we debuted <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1752/events/boa-retina/"><em>Boa Retina</em>, a physical, multi-device game</a> from Austin artist Jennifer Raye. </p>
<p>The aim of the arcade of anything artist residency is to provide artists with a month-long opportunity to push into experimental and unexplored territory within digital games, art, and other interactive works. The arcade of anything de-emphasizes commercially-viable products or finished works in favor of strange and wonderful projects that facilitate creative growth, unexpected collaborations, and community engagement.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/residencies/">our residencies section</a> for more information on the program and to apply -- we look forward to hearing what you'd like to make soon!</p>
