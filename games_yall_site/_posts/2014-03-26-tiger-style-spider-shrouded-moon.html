<p>As you might recall or have seen yourself, <a href="http://venuspatrol.com/2014/01/hey-austin-next-thursday-get-first-look-tiger-styles-spider-rite-shrouded-moon/">our February meetup</a> consisted of local developers <a href="http://tigerstylegames.com/">Tiger Style</a> taking to the stage and giving Austin the first look behind the curtain at their upcoming game <em><a href="http://www.shroudedmoon.com/">Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon</a></em>. </p>
<p>The game -- a sequel to the 2009 iPhone original <em><a href="http://venuspatrol.com/2009/08/touch-me-im-slick-the-silky-sl/">Spider: The Secret of Bryce Manor</a></em> -- is set to expand on the first with an even larger and richer world, which again layers super approachable web-slinging and insect-eating mechanics over the deeper, unspoken mysteries of the locations in which it takes place, left for the player to delve into and uncover of their own accord.</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To help give everyone everywhere equal opportunity to prepare to piece together those mysteries, we present here full video of the night's proceedings. Above you'll find a complete walkthrough of some early levels that introduces many of the mechanics you will remember from the first, as well as a number of new features, including one that changes the content of the game based on the time & weather around you in the real world.</p>
<p>And, at top, Tiger Style co-founder Randy Smith gives some background on the locations, magic & secret societies which inspired the fiction of the game, which will be followed by some additional <a href="http://blog.tigerstylegames.com/">new material appearing on Tiger Style's own blog soon</a>... along with more information on the game itself, which <a href="http://www.shroudedmoon.com/">you can find right here</a>.</p>
