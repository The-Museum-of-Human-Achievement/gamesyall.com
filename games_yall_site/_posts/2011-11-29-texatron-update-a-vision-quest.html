<p>The TEXATRON Initiative is making good progress.  TEX-001 is still in James' kitchen, as previously pictured, but some awesome new volunteers have stepped in to help keep things moving forward.  First, Leah Smith from the <a href="http://governor.state.tx.us/film">Texas Film Commision</a> has bravely volunteered to take over the organization of the project.  Second, Joshua Fields from the <a href="http://drafthouse.com/">Alamo Drafthouse</a> is lending us his expertise in figuring out what to do next and how to do it.  Between the two of them, we have a task list and set of measurements for the cabinet, and are nearly ready to gut it and rebuild it from the glorious ground up!</p>
<p>HOWEVER... we've reached a crossroads.  Bob Sabiston of <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/Flat_Black_Films/Home.html">Flat Black Films</a> donated an awesome 21" CRT monitor that is perfect for an arcade cabinet... but it's really ideal for a dark location, where we can show off that glow.  The current plan for TEX-001 is to install it at the radical <a href="http://www.domystore.com/">Domy Books</a>, which is much more of a daylight place.  Which means that TEX-001 would really benefit from having a larger LCD monitor, and we can save that luminous CRT for TEX-002 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>So, we come to you with a plea... with a vision quest.  Do you or anyone you know have a 24" (or even better, 27"!) LCD computer monitor that they would be willing to donate to the TEXATRON Initiative?</strong></p>
<p>As always, let us know by contacting as at <a href="mailto:texatron@gmail.com">texatron@gmail.com</a>! Thank you!</p>
