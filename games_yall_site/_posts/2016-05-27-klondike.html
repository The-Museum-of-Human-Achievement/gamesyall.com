<p>Ready for another inspiring night of contemplative & beautiful games? Then be sure to join us next <strong>Thursday, June 2nd, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents the work of <a href="http://klondike.fr/">Klondike</a>, France's staggeringly talented independent game collective.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1039531142792488/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p><iframe   allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>You may have caught a few games made by Klondike members at various prior Fantastic Arcades -- or even all the way back to <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/350/news/greetings-from-the-space-cowboy-arcade/">our first Marfa Film Festival installation</a> -- but we've never had an entire night devoted to the group's collected work, until now.</p>
<p>Collectively hailing from various points around France, the ten-strong group of developers (some of whom gave an overview of the collective's formation at a 2015 Fantastic Arcade talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhgMSCmgwbk">you can watch in its entirety here</a>) has established itself as an incredibly prolific powerhouse of understated games with bold & beautiful aesthetics -- as evidenced by even <a href="http://klondike.fr/">a cursory glance at their website</a>.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/imageB.png" alt="imageB"   /></p>
<p>For our special "Introducing: Klondike" show, we'll be bringing along a wide selection of games from all the diverse members of the group, including <em><a href="https://polclarissou.itch.io/orchids-to-dusk">Orchids to Dusk</a></em> (the video above), from member <a href="http://polclarissou.com">Pol Clarissou</a>, Titouan Millet's brilliantly opaque and mysterious <em><a href="http://titouanm.com/mucartographer/">Mu Cartographer</a></em> (the screenshot above), and much, much more.</p>
