<p>As you've by now probably heard, JUEGOS RANCHEROS is now <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/308/news/austin-creative-alliance/">an Austin Creative Alliance sponsored group</a>, meaning that we can now <a href="http://austincreativealliance.roundtablelive.org/jr">accept cash & in-kind donations via ACA</a> that are tax-deductible for you. </p>
<p>And while we haven't yet pulled together anything as formal as <a href="http://www.babycastles.com/">the membership drive currently being put together by our friends at Babycastles</a>, all of our internal discussions keep coming back to one thing: all we want for Xmas is one Windows laptop.</p>
<p>As Adam <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/308/news/austin-creative-alliance/">mentioned in his post</a>, every public event we put on results in a mad scramble to beg/borrow/steal hardware from friends & family for you to play games on, and having the freedom to know that we had official, reliable JUEGOS hardware would be an unbelievable first step for us.</p>
<p>We don't exactly have a dream machine, but something along the lines of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Y510p-15-6-Inch-Laptop/dp/B00CRXZSYQ">this Lenovo laptop</a> is a good start -- quad-core, pretty future-proof & able to handle whatever we throw at it. </p>
<p>That's a big "ask" though, but we also know that local studios frequently upgrade their own desktop/laptop hardware at the end of the year, and would like to remind everyone that you can get an additional tax writeoff by giving JUEGOS your last-year's models -- everything helps!</p>

<p>We're also always in need of additional hardware like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Xbox-360-Controller-Windows/dp/B004QRKWLA">wired Xbox 360 controllers for Windows</a>, 25"+ HDMI widescreen monitors, non-powered 4-8 port USB hubs & USB extension cables, over-the-ear headphones, wired mice, powerstrips & more!</p>
<p>If you or someone you know might be able to help us reach our goal of a single, nice, reliable Windows laptop by the end of the year -- or any other donations that can help us better serve Austin's indie community! -- please let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:juegosrancheros@gmail.com">juegosrancheros@gmail.com</a> & we can help guide you through the donation process!</p>
