<p>What better way to play the most beautiful upcoming game about space than in a planetarium? There <em>is</em> no better way, as you'll find out <strong>Thursday, August 1st, at 7:00PM</strong>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents <a href="http://elevenminutesofspace.com/">Christoffer Hedborg's <em>Eleven</em></a>, inside an actual inflatable planetarium at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, with soundtrack artist Datahowler performing live.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1742955279179014">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p><em>Eleven</em> creator Hedborg has made a strong name for himself as an amazing <a href="http://www.christofferhedborg.com/creations/">low-poly/high-beauty artist</a> since his <a href="http://www.christofferhedborg.com/toys">IGF 2011 Student Showcase debut <em>Toys</em></a>, as well as a founding member of the <a href="http://weirdkidscollective.com/">#weirdkids art collective</a>, and a developer on commercial works like <em><a href="http://www.pidgame.com/">Pid</a></em> & the upcoming <em><a href="http://shelterthegame.com/">Shelter</a></em> for Swedish studio <a href="http://mightanddelight.com/">Might & Delight</a>.</p>

<p>But it's <em>Eleven</em> that remains his most exciting upcoming work, an exploration game that presents the sort of outer-space we all secretly dream it could be: <a href="http://www.christofferhedborg.com/projects/">an infinite field of gorgeous, abstract, unknowable geometry</a> that's all ours to explore.</p>

<p>To help us present the game in the best way, we're partnering with <a href="http://www.austinplanetarium.org/">Austin's upcoming Science Museum & Planetarium</a> to set up their inflatable planetarium inside the venue itself -- so players can lie down, stretch out, and let the game unfold all around them -- as well as a short presentation by Science Museum & Planetarium executive director Torvald Hessel to talk about bringing the mystery & magic of space to our city.</p>

<p>Even better, we'll have <a href="http://datahowler.bandcamp.com/">Dallas electro wizard Datahowler</a> -- the musician behind <em>Eleven</em>'s laid back & chilled out soundtrack -- live at the North Door as a super special guest star, to perform selections from the game and more. </p>
<p>That and much more will be kicking off <strong>Thursday, August 1st, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, play, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
