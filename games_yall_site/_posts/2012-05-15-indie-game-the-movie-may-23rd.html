<p>Hey Austin game-lovers: missed the SXSW screenings of <a href="http://www.indiegamethemovie.com/">INDIE GAME: THE MOVIE</a>? We've got good news: Blinkworks is bringing back the film for one night only, <a href="http://drafthouse.com/movies/indie_game_the_movie/austin">Wednesday, May 23rd at 6:45pm</a>, to the South Lamar Alamo Drafthouse!</p>
<p>Put together with the help of Kickstarter supporters, INDIE GAME: THE MOVIE spent two years documenting the development of Team Meat's SUPER MEAT BOY & Polytron's FEZ, alongside a look backward at Jonathan Blow's work on BRAID, all set to a beautiful soundtrack by Jim Guthrie of SWORD & SWORCERY EP fame.</p>
<p>At least a few of us from the JUEGOS community will be attending, and leading a short Q&A following the film. </p>
<p>Tickets <a href="http://drafthouse.com/movies/indie_game_the_movie/austin">have just gone online</a> at the Drafthouse: pick them up now and join us!</p>

<p>As a coincidental side note, Jim Guthrie's soundtrack has <a href="http://jimguthrie.bandcamp.com/releases">just officially gone on sale</a>, and is now available in digital form, double LP, and a super limited double-LP + T-shirt package, all designed by JUEGOS superpal <a href="http://cargocollective.com/coryschmitz">Cory Schmitz</a>! Preview the music and <a href="http://jimguthrie.bandcamp.com/releases">pick up any of the packages at Bandcamp</a>!</p>
