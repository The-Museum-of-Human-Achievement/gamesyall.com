<p>It's the first JUEGOS RANCHEROS meetup of 2018, and we're back with more multiplayer madness! Come join us <strong>Thursday, January 4th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents <em><a href="https://theworldtrees.itch.io/zodiac-mall-ball">Zodiac Mall Ball</a></em>, a brand new local multiplayer game from a superstar team of developers behind games like <em>Hyper Light Drifter, Beglitched</em> & more!</p>
<p>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/769926066542751/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</p>
