<p>In addition to our favorites, we’ll also be showcasing more multi- and single-player games by the game’s developers, on top of the usual ‘indie alley’ games brought in by Austin’s local game community!</p>
<p>You can play these games and more Wednesday, January 2nd, at 7:00PM at North Door, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702, with a short introduction at 8:00PM. The show is free, all ages, and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
