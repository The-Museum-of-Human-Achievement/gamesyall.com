<p>I'm pretty sure you all can't handle this but I'm laying it on you anyways:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/photo3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/photo3-764x1024.jpg" alt="" title="photo(3)" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-105" /></a></p>
<p>That's right!!  The <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TEXATRON">TEXATRON</a> Initiative is <em>PHASE TWO COMPLETE</em>.  We have a radical cabinet, courtesy Austin's own <a href="http://www.retrostudios.com/">Retro Studios</a>, a way over-powered PC donated by immaculate human <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unassembly">Russell Fincher</a>, and a sweet 21" CRT thanks to the generosity of cinema-code legend <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/Flat_Black_Films/Home.html">Bob Sabiston of Flat Black Films</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/photo.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/photo-764x1024.jpg" alt="" title="photo" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-102" /></a></p>
<p>And I don't know if you noticed, but if you look closely in the photos, you can see that the PC is already running the latest build of <a href="http://winnitron.ca/">the WINNITRON launcher</a>, the cutting edge of indie arcade networks, coming to us straight from <a href="http://bitcollective.ca/">The Bit Collective</a> in Winnipeg, Canada.  The OS and WINNITRON install was performed by <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/">JUEGOS</a> volunteer <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Robert_Cop">Robert Gaither</a>, who did an awesome job.  Finally, the TEXATRON itself is currently being housed by JUEGOS mustache aficionado and <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/authors/james-renovitch/">Austin Chronicle writer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/renovitch">James Renovitch</a>.</p>
<p>So high five those bros next time you catch them up.</p>

<p>Now, I probably don't need to spell this out for you all, but if Phase Two is complete... I'm pretty sure that means <strong>it's time for Phase Three, a.k.a. <em>the fun part</em>.</strong>  Phase Three involves gutting the existing cabinet and rebuilding the interior from the ground up to support our new PC and monitor, including building a new, USB-compatible control panel, replacing the speakers, and finally doing the trim and artwork. And maybe adding some steer horns to the top.</p>

<p><strong>If this sounds like your sort of thing, I recommend shooting us an email at <a href="mailto:texatron@gmail.com">texatron@gmail.com</a></strong>, and we'll add you to our volunteer spreadsheet! If you also include relevant skills, interests, and schedule or availability, that would be a huge help to us!  We are also specifically looking for someone to head up Phase Three in a slightly more official way; this person's responsibilities will include coordinating with James to figure out the best times for building sessions and organizing and emailing the relevant volunteers.  So, if you think you have the ingredients, let us know, and become a part of Austin culture history!</p>
