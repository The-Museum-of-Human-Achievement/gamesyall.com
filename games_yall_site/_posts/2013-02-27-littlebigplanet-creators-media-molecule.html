<p>Flying in all the way from Guildford, UK, the Media Molecule team will be presenting -- for the first time ever -- the results of its own first-ever internal game jam, with, says the company, "photos and videos of things we made -- games yes, but a whole load of weirdness, too."</p>
<p>The team will talk through the process of running a game jam and the weird stuff they did alongside it, and then "a bit about how we applied it to our real dev process."</p>

<p>Before that, the night will open with the first look at the upcoming <em>SoundSelf</em>, a game that "combines your own voice with evolving fractal graphics and mind-altering auditory feedback" being created by local sound designer Robin Arnott, with live musical accompaniment by Austin electronic guitarist Michael Garfield.</p>
<p>Following the presentations, the night will conclude with more music by JUEGOS RANCHEROS' own resident <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CosmicDjGame">Cosmic DJ</a>, and more! Everything will be kicking off <strong>Thursday, March 7th, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, dance, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
