<p>Want to get a rapid-fire, head-to-head, competitive trip back through all of videogame history? Then be sure to join us <strong>Thursday, September 1st, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents a sneak-peek at <em>Multibowl</em>, a brand new multiplayer mashup of hundreds of vintage games. </p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/131455837303195/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>Co-created by <a href="https://twitter.com/bfod">Bennett Foddy</a> (creator of <em><a href="https://www.foddy.net/Athletics.html">QWOP</a>, <a href="http://www.foddy.net/GIRP.html">GIRP</a></em> & one of the leads behind <em><a href="http://sportsfriendsgame.com/">Sportsfriends</a></em>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/bad_tetris">Alec Thomson</a> (himself co-creator of last year's Fantastic Arcade favorite, <em><a href="http://beglitched.net/">Beglitched</a></em>), <em>Multibowl</em> gives two players a fast-paced series of tiny fragments of emulated games collected from the past 30+ years, and keeps a running meta-tally of each player's success. </p>

<p>The <em>Multibowl</em> winner is the one who can adapt to each fragment as it's tossed their way, be it a classic fighting game, a cult-classic arcade puzzler, or straight up just 15 seconds of the actual Super Nintendo version of <em>Mario Kart</em>. </p>
