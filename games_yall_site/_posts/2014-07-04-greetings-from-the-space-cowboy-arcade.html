<p>Did you visit us in Marfa & want to learn more, or are you curious what's up with JUEGOS RANCHEROS at the <a href="http://www.marfafilmfestival.com/">Marfa Film Festival</a>? It's currently day two of the four-day pop-up Space Cowboy Arcade, and the reception so far has been great! </p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/screenshot.184-1024x576.jpg" alt="screenshot.184" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-352" /></p>
<p>Chosen from the nearly 60 submissions we received after the two-week <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">Space Cowboy Game Jam</a> -- all of which are free for everyone to <a href="http://itch.io/jam/space-cowboy-jam">download and play at the jam website</a> -- visitors to the Arcade are able to explore and play through a rotating selection of games (including those seen above). </p>

<p>Our hope was that we could provide a down-tempo quasi-chill-out-space for festival attendees to experience games that reflected the same lonesome, existential romance of the surrounding desert, and we wanted to give a quick thanks to Marfa Film Festival organizers for bringing us into the fold alongside <a href="http://www.marfafilmfestival.com/2014-program/">a fantastic lineup of features & shorts</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have more images from the Arcade in the coming weeks, but thanks as well for now to everyone who's stopped by, and -- of course -- to all the devs that participated in the jam (and to the amazing <a href="http://kohwritten.com/">Irene Koh</a> for <a href="http://prom-knight.tumblr.com/post/89409036198/poster-i-did-for-the-space-cowboy-game-jam-it">her poster image at top</a>!) and gave us something incredible to show!</p>
