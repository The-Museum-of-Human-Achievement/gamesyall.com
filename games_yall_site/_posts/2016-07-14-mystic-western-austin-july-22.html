<p>Greetings from the West Texas high desert town of Marfa, where for the third year JUEGOS RANCHEROS has presented a selection of games at the Marfa Film Festival!</p>
<p>As you've probably seen by now, we brought out a number of games from our recent <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mysticwestern">Mystic Western Game Jam</a> (which saw <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1260/news/50-games-mystic-western-game-jam/">nearly 50 games entered</a> from developers all around the world), which we've installed here in the old Chamber of Commerce office suite at the historic Paisano Hotel. </p>

<p>We'll be set up here through the end of the festival on Sunday, but if you weren't able to make it out, we've got good news: we'll be bringing our selections back home to Austin for a special exhibition in our indie arcade space, the Museum of Human Amusement, <strong>next Friday, July 22nd</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll have all the game stations we brought out west available, alongside drinks and other music performances and projections starting at 8PM and going until everyone's had their fill.</p>

<p>[<em>Special thanks also to our new friends at <a href="http://www.bigbendbrewing.com/">Big Bend Brewing</a> -- our actual favorite West Texas beer -- for providing the drinks for our Austin show!</em>]</p>
<p>Below the fold, we've included the mini-poster we've papered Marfa with, which we'll also have for sale at the event (special thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/mousefountain">G.P. Lackey</a> for his amazing poster art & animation at top), as well as a list of some of the Mystic Western Game Jam games we're rotating through our multi-selector.</p>
<p>The Mystic Western exhibition will be held <strong>next Friday, July 22 at 8:00 PM</strong>, at <a href="http://http://themuseumofhumanachievement.com/">Museum of Human Achievement</a>, Austin, TX. The event is open to all ages, with donations warmly accepted.</p>
