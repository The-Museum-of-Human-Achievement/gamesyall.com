<p>After well over a year of build-up and preparation, the day has finally come: JUEGOS RANCHEROS has officially given the first of its <a href="http://texatron.com/">TEXATRON</a> machines a permanent home at <a href="http://www.guzugallery.com/">Guzu</a>, Austin's new best designer toy/art/comic shop & gallery.</p>
<p>What this means for you is that now you can go play Messhof's still-unbelievably-highly-anticipated <em><a href="http://www.messhof.com/NIDHOGG">Nidhogg</a></em>, for free, whenever you want, during Guzu's operating hours -- as well as a <a href="http://winnitron.ca/games/">slew of other games on the Winnitron network</a>, including special 2-player builds of <em>Canabalt</em> & <em>Super Crate Box</em>, and much more.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/nidd1.png" alt="nidd1" width="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-82919" /></p>
<p>The installation is just the first of what we hope will be many more to come, as well as the prelude to many enhancements to the Winnitron's front- and back-ends to make machines like the TEXATRON perfect cultural-outreach machines to bring interesting, beautiful videogames to a wider and cross-cultural audience.</p>
<p>If you're in Austin, drop by Guzu at <a href="http://www.guzugallery.com/content/about-us">5000 N Lamar Blvd</a> -- just next door to <a href="http://www.austinbooks.com/">Austin Books & Comics</a> -- and be sure to browse around for a legitimately amazing selection of books & toys while you're there. Keep your eyes on <a href="http://texatron.com/">the TEXATRON site</a> for more news about upcoming locations, and <a href="http://winnitron.ca/">investigate the Winnitron site</a> if you'd like to bring machines like this to your own town.</p>
