<p>Over a thousand years ago the human race teetered on the edge of extinction. They were helpless against the mighty behemoths of the land. And then, salvation… Cricket was invented! Go alone, or take a friend of your choice, on a journey through the rich, and exquisitely accurate, history of cricket.</p>
