<p>Wonder what your favorite indie developers might make with an imaginary 8-bit console that never existed until now? Join us this <strong>Thursday, December 3rd, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents  a variety of amazing games for <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>, a new way to make, share & play tiny games. </p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1649960705252889/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>What exactly is the PICO-8? Created by Joseph '<a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/">Lexaloffle</a>' White (also known for <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/voxatron.php">the Voxatron</a>), it's a "fantasy console" that doesn't just play games, but contains all budding designers need to create new works of their own, and share those games on the web or via downloadable "carts" -- which are actually just <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/cposts/1/17235.p8.png">PNG image files</a> containing all the code to run the game! </p>

<p>For our JUEGOS RANCHEROS presentation, we'll be bringing a selection of games made for <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2769">the world's first PICO-8 game jam</a>, which just drew to a close and has voting for best game underway.</p>
