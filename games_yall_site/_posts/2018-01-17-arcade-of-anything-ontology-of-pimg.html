<p>You're invited to join us <strong>Friday, January 19th at 7:00 PM</strong> at the <a href="http://www.themuseumofhumanachievement.com">Museum of Human Achievement</a> for the opening exhibition of <em>Ontology of PIMG</em>, created by our Winter 2017/2018 resident artists, <a href="https://liooil.space/">Stephanie Mendoza</a> & <a href="http://xhurch.net/matt_henderson_cv/">Matt Henderson</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1250125698420797/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</strong></p>
<p>Henderson and Mendoza are multimedia artists from Portland, specializing in 3D/VR toolsets & creative workflows. The pair are essential members of <a href="http://pdximmersive.media/">Portland Immersive Media Group</a> (PIMG) — a group of tech-savvy artists exploring the creative potentials of 3D/VR/AR while also engaging in critical dialogue around the implications of the increasing abundance of tech in our lives.  </p>
<p>Together, the pair will exhibit the work created by PIMG, which arose through informal collaborative processes and evolved into interlinking worlds threaded together by spacialized interface that is part memory temple, part goodwill. </p>

ABOUT OUR ARTISTS:</p>
<p><a href="https://liooil.space/">Stephanie Mendoza</a> is an Immersive Media Artist and Social VR Pilot. Her goals are experimenting with the design fundamentals and social implications of virtual spaces, making all attempts to share the knowledge through talks, workshops, and personal engagements.</p>
<p><a href="http://xhurch.net/matt_henderson_cv/">Matt Henderson</a> is a multidisciplinary artist melding installation art, music production, film, performance art, and virtual reality. He started a DIY performance venue and living space in Portland, OR called Xhurch which caters to the experimental artist community. After co-directing the M.A.S.S. music & performance series he became enamored with virtual reality as a robust creative medium. He organized a group of digital and new media artists under the banner of Portland Immersive Media Group and continues to explore the potential of experiential art in both real and virtual environments.</p>
<p>[<em>Created in partnership with the Museum of Human Achievement, the <strong>arcade of anything</strong> artist residency encourages its participants to push into experimental and unexplored territory within digital arts.
