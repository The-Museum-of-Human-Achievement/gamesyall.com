<p>What's so indie about the highly-anticipated PlayStation 3 shooter <a href="http://www.starhawkthegame.com/index/">STARHAWK</a>? Find out <strong>this Sunday, November 6th, at 4PM</strong> at our sixth edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at the Highball, as the team designing the game at our own Austin-local <a href="http://www.lightboxinteractive.com/">LightBox Interactive</a> show off their personal side-projects, and explain how working on abstract indie games ends up influencing big-budget AAA designs.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=268872349817302">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>In attendance at this month's JUEGOS RANCHEROS will be STARHAWK lead designer Josh Sutphin with his games <a href="http://www.third-helix.com/blog/?page_id=1099">FAIL-DEADLY</a> and <a href="http://www.third-helix.com/blog/?page_id=828">CORTEX</a>, designer Matthew Gallant with his one-button underwater battler <a href="http://paxbritannica.henk.ca/">PAX BRITANNICA</a>, and designer Trent Polack with his collection of abstract indie games including <a href="http://www.polycat.net/games/">IN THE WIND, ASPLODE! and BROKEN</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to simply showing off their work, the team will touch on the development of STARHAWK, specifically how indie development and philosophies themselves can be integrated into a bigger commercial design, and the importance of drawing design influences from a wider variety of media and experiences, followed by public play of all the games brought to the show!</p>
<p>There will also be cake.</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, November 6th, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come hang out, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
<p>[*PS: Hey everyone! As usual, bring your 3DS again! We're doing awesome with these StreetPasses!]</p>
