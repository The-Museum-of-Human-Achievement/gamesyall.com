<p>The oppressive summer heat is officially upon us, and JUEGOS RANCHEROS is here to bring you in to the cool! So join us <strong>Thursday, July 6, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> — as we present a mix of just-released and recently-remastered games!</p>
<p>[ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/497249050627663">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a> ]</p>
<p>Previously <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1086/events/juegos-rancheros-presents-super-russian-roulette/">featured in early 2016</a> and now making its triumphant return in its final form will be <em><a href="https://superrussianroulette.com/">Super Russian Roulette</a></em>, a brand new game for the original 8-bit NES from NYC-based hardware hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/batslyadams">Andrew Reitano</a>.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeFSxS1xUjc</p>
<p>The game lets up to three players play russian roulette against an on-screen cowboy using the NES Zapper light gun. (Remember <em>Duck Hunt</em>?) And, thanks to backers of his successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/batslyadams/super-russian-roulette-a-new-party-game-for-the-ne">Kickstarter campaign</a>, <em>Super Russian Roulette</em> has just been released on a limited run of real NES cartridges! </p>
<hr />
<p>Also appearing will be <em><a href="http://bubsy3d.com/">Bubsy 3D: Bubsy Visits the James Turrell Retrospective</a></em>, a newly-remastered version of the <a href="http://arcanekids.com/">Arcane Kids</a> game we <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/306/a-fistful-of-indies/november-2013/">recommended all the way back in 2013</a>, which turned out to be one of the tongue-in-cheek funniest and most interesting games of the year. </p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akNVeQKRZFQ</p>
<p>No relation to the newly announced revival of the classic (?) Bubsy franchise, <em>Bubsy 3D</em> lets players visit the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to learn more about the work of contemporary light artist James Turrell, and... so much more that's best left for you to explore yourself. </p>
<hr />
<p>Finally, we'll be bringing <em><a href="https://jenniferraye.itch.io/boa-retina">Boa Retina</a></em> — the game produced for our latest artist residency program — from Austin's own <a href="https://twitter.com/jenn_raye">Jennifer Raye</a>, for all those that weren't able to make it to <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1752/events/boa-retina/">our opening night show</a>.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVXnQErqgrE</p>
<p>The game "dives deep into messy gender uncertainty," says Raye, through "an uncomfortable blend of abstract golden-age arcade design, retro computer aesthetic, the unhealthy ways my gender feelings manifested before coming out, and external conflicts from things trying to keep life in order." </p>
<hr />
<p>The exhibition will begin <strong>Thursday, July 6, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>, with a short introduction at 8:00PM. The show is free, all ages, and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
