<p>All the way back in 2011, JUEGOS RANCHEROS got its start thanks to the generosity & support of Alamo Drafthouse & its offshoot lounge, The Highball. </p>
<p>Though we eventually had to relocate our monthly meetup due to construction at the Alamo's South Lamar location, we're very proud to announce that beginning <strong>tonight, May 13th, at 10:30PM</strong>, we'll be returning to <a href="https://thehighball.com/">The Highball</a> for <a href="https://thehighball.com/events/detail/27800/">a new, weekly Fantastic Arcade event</a>. </p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/hb_br.jpg" alt="hb_br"   /></p>
<p>These new events will be held weekly on each Wednesday night -- following <a href="http://geekswhodrink.com/venue?id=101125">Geeks Who Drink trivia</a> -- <strong>except the first Wednesday of each month</strong>, the night before <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/category/events/">our regular JUEGOS RANCHEROS events</a> at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">The North Door</a>. </p>
<p>The events will run from 10:30PM to basically whenever everyone gets tuckered out, and while they'll be somewhat more relaxed than our North Door events, we guarantee they'll be no less enlightening & fun.</p>
<p>It'll likely take us a little time to settle into this new, weekly groove and set up programming that you can rely on (we're still working out hosts & themes for each event), but expect us to try out new things both more experimental (non-videogames??) and more traditional (beloved multiplayer console games??).</p>
<p>We hope you'll join us beginning <strong>tonight, May 13th, at 10:30PM</strong> at The Highball's <strong>1120 S Lamar Blvd</strong> location (directly next door to the South Lamar Alamo Drafthouse), for food, drinks and late-night play!</p>
