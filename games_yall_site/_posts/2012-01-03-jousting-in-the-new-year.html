<p>It's the first meetup of the New Year, and we're celebrating it by bringing back two fan favorites from 2011: <strong>this Sunday, January 8th, at 4PM</strong>, our eighth edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball will see the return of Die Gute Fabrik's slow-motion dueling game <a href="http://jsjoust.com/">JOHANN SEBASTIAN JOUST</a> and Messhof's <a href="http://messhof.com/nidhogg/">NIDHOGG</a> (via our prototype indie-game arcade machine, the <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/category/texatron">TEXATRON</a>).</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/205282609561311/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>

<p>First debuted here in Austin all the way back at our second meetup, <a href="http://jsjoust.com/">J.S. JOUST</a> instantly became a local hit, as we saw again last month at its return for the Venus Patrol party. If you've still not had the chance to play, you'll definitely want be there this Sunday to experience how it transforms any group of friends & strangers into a slow-motion dancing, dueling swirl.</p>

<p>We'll also be bringing back our in-progress version of the indie arcade machine TEXATRON to project on the big screen, which we understand essentially means another few hours devoted to Messhof's crowd-pleasing low-res masterpiece <a href="http://messhof.com/nidhogg/">NIDHOGG</a>.</p>
<p>Both games are still basically unavailable to play elsewhere, so this will be your only chance to see why they're so well-loved, worldwide!</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, January 8th, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come hang out, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
