<p><em><a href="http://www.shroudedmoon.com/">Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon</a></em> -- developed here in Austin by Tiger Style and <a href="http://www.shroudedmoon.com/">being released for iOS & Steam</a> on the same night as our meetup -- is a game in which you play as a clever arachnid explorer, mastering your web crafting skills with a combination of action and planning as you solve each of Spider's seven enigmatic puzzles. </p>

<p><a href="http://playfeist.net/">Just released</a> by Austin publisher Finji & developed by Switzerland's Bits & Beasts, <em><a href="http://playfeist.net/">Feist</a></em> is a lush and visually striking action-packed game in which you outwit a sprawling forest full of secret danger and fierce creatures. </p>

<p>And finally, first featured as <a href="http://www.byfernando.com/blog/2012/10/panoramical/">a surprise addition</a> to Fantastic Arcade 2012, Fernando Ramallo & David Kanaga's <em><a href="http://www.panoramic.al/">Panoramical</a></em> is just on the cusp of its final release, co-presented by Finji & Polytron. We'll be debuting this latest version of the interactive musical landscape anthology, in which you immerse yourself in a series of synaesthetic alien vistas, like an ambient disco-god controlling your own tiny universe.</p>
<p>All of the games will be playable <strong>Thursday, August 6th, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>. The show is free and open to all the public, so come join us as we drink, play and meet the people changing the way we think about games!</p>
