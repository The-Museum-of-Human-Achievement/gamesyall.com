<p>Following <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1811/news/fantastic-arcade-new-games-by-qwop-towerfall-ftl-more/">our announcement of brand new games</a> from the artists behind <em>Panoramical, Beglitched, Fjords</em> and <em>Strawberry Cubes</em> making their debut at <a href="http://fantasticarcade.com/">Fantastic Arcade</a>, we have just announced more than 20 additional games rounding out this year's showcase lineup.</p>
<p>The games join <a href="http://juegosrancheros.com/1811/news/fantastic-arcade-new-games-by-qwop-towerfall-ftl-more/">the 10 previously-announced Spotlight games</a> coming to Austin, TX's Alamo Drafthouse Mueller this November 17-19th, and were chosen by JUEGOS RANCHEROS from the hundreds of games submitted from developers around the world.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/discover2-1024x576.png" alt=""   /></p>
<p>This year's showcase games will include long-anticipated breakouts like Capy's dungeon crawler <em>Below</em> (above), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junji_Ito">Junji Ito</a>-inspired point and click adventure <em>World of Horror</em> (pictured at top) and <em>Wilmot's Warehouse</em>, the latest game from the creators of <em>Hohokum</em> and last year's <a href="https://fantasticarcade.com/awards/">Audience Choice award winner</a>, <em>Loot Rascals</em>. All of the 20+ showcase games coming to this year's festival are listed in full below the fold. </p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/15145799883_ea2efac1ba_o-1024x768.jpg" alt=""   /></p>
<p>In addition to the new games, we are also announcing the theme for this year's <a href="https://fantasticarcade.itch.io/">Fantastic Arcade Gamemaking Frenzy</a>. Games submitted during the two-week game jam will be exhibited at Fantastic Arcade's game-show-like live finale, Starcade. </p>
<p>This year's theme is <strong><em><a href="https://itch.io/jam/phony-island">Phony Island</a></em></strong>, in homage to Fantastic Arcade's new home — Alamo Drafthouse's boardwalk carnival-esque bar, the <a href="http://barrelofunatx.com/">Barrel O Fun</a>. The jam will be open to developers from around the world to submit their best 2-player microgame in the style of an almost-but-just-this-side-of-not-copyright-infringing carnival games <small>(<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/11041965@N02/15145799883">above photo credit</a>)</small>.</p>
<p>The two-week game jam will kick off Monday, October 30th at <a href="https://itch.io/jam/phony-island">itch.io's #phonyisland</a> jam site, with a submission deadline of Sunday, November 12th, at 11:59pm CST.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, Fantastic Arcade will also be announcing its full lineup of its special nightly tournaments — an annual fan-favorite tradition — exposition plays, panel discussions, developer talks, and much more.</p>
<p>Tickets for Fantastic Arcade are <a href="https://fantasticarcade.com/attend/">available now at its website</a>. Now a fully independent festival, Juegos Rancheros would like to remind all attendees, developers and staff that the event is covered by <a href="https://fantasticarcade.com/safespace/">our Safe Spaces Policy</a>, which can be reviewed in its entirety <a href="https://fantasticarcade.com/safespace/">at the Fantastic Arcade website</a>.</p>
