<p>JUEGOS RANCHEROS is pleased to announce Robby Kraft as the Fall 2016 <strong>arcade of anything</strong> resident.</p>
<p>Currently residing in New York City, <a href="http://www.robbykraft.com">Robby Kraft</a> is a software developer and origami master with a special interest in geometry and scale.

<p>Kraft's residency will conclude with a public exhibition on Friday, September 30 at JUEGOS RANCHEROS’s indie arcade space, the <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/the-museum-of-human-amusement/">Museum of Human Amusement</a>. This exhibition falls on the day after <a href="http://www.fantasticarcade.com">Fantastic Arcade</a> ends, so plan to stay in Austin for the week and catch both wonderful events!</p>
