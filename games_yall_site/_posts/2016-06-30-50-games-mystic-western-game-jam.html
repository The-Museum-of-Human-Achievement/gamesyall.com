<p>Over the past 14 days, some of our favorite developers and friends alike have risen to the challenge, and now the results are available: there are now 50 some odd games created for <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/1214/jams/the-mystic-western-game-jam/">our Mystic Western Game Jam</a>, ready for you to play.</p>
<p>There are plenty of familiar faces, old Fantastic Arcade featured developers, as well as more than a few amazing newcomers that have contributed, so clear away your weekend plans now and <a href="https://itch.io/jam/mysticwestern">visit the Mystic Western page on itch.io</a> to start perusing and downloading.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, we'll be collecting our favorite games together & preparing to bring them out to the real-actual mystical West Texas desert for the <a href="http://www.marfafilmfestival.com/">Marfa Film Festival</a>. There, they'll be exhibited at <a href="http://hotelpaisano.com/">the historic Hotel Paisano</a>, located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Dh3JJ8DTtZQ2">207 N Highland Street</a>,  right there in that last set of three windows on the far right of the circa-1930s postcard below.</p>

<p>After the Film Festival, they'll also be part of <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/events/">our next exhibition at The Museum of Human Amusement</a> here in Austin -- we'll have more details on that in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Our biggest thanks to all of the developers who took part in the jam -- we hope you had as much fun creating the games as we'll have showing them to the wider world!</p>
