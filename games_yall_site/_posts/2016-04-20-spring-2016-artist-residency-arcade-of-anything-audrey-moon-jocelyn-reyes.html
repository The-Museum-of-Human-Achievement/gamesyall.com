<p>JUEGOS RANCHEROS is pleased to announce that local indie developers <a href="http://loveme.computer" target="_blank">Audrey Moon</a> and <a href="http://littledesertsound.io">Jocelyn Reyes</a> have been selected to participate in our very first <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/residencies/"><strong>arcade of anything</strong> artist residency</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1158 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/BrowserPreview_tmp-3.gif" alt="Morning Coffee"   /></p>
<p>Moon, a UI designer and artist, and Reyes, a sound designer, are frequent collaborators. The pair have worked together on experimental, shortform games like Fantastic Arcade 2014 selection <a href="http://animalphase.com/press/sheet.php?p=lost_in_the_woods" target="_blank"><em>Lost in the Woods</em></a>, <em><a href="https://animalphase.itch.io/morning-coffee">Morning Coffee</a></em> (pictured above), and the recently-released autobiographical work <a href="https://animalphase.itch.io/into"><em>Into</em></a>. </p>
<p>However, their creative production extends outside of their collaborative work as well, from Moon's graphic design practice to Reyes's sound work with Austin game studios <a href="http://finji.co" target="_blank">Finji</a> and <a href="http://tacoilluminati.com" target="_blank">Taco Illuminati</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1163 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jr-archive/arcade.jpg" alt="arcade"   /></p>
<p>The month-long <strong>arcade of anything</strong> artist residency, created in partnership with the <a href="http://themuseumofhumanachievement.com">Museum of Human Achievement</a>, encourages participants to push into experimental and unexplored territory within digital arts. </p>
<p>The residency will conclude with a public exhibition of the work undertaken at JUEGOS RANCHEROS's indie arcade space, <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/the-museum-of-human-amusement/">the Museum of Human Amusement</a>. You can read more about the newly-announced residency program <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/residencies/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please join us in congratulating Audrey Moon and Jocelyn Reyes, and stay tuned for details on their exhibition event in the second half of May 2016.</p>
