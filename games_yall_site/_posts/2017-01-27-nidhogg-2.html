<p>Excited to play the sequel to <a href="http://messhof.com/">Messhof</a>'s long-standing JUEGOS RANCHEROS favorite? Then you will absolutely not want our next meetup — <strong>Thursday, February 2nd, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a> — as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents <em><a href="http://nidhogggame.com/">Nidhogg 2</a></em>. </p>

<p>The original <em>Nidhogg</em> has been a JUEGOS RANCHEROS mainstay since our original inception in 2011 — with frequent meetup & Fantastic Arcade appearances — and all signs point to the sequel carrying on that tradition.</p>

<p>Featuring all of the same "fast-paced hilarious stabby action", but now with a much larger array of new weapons, new stages and new music from Daedelus, Dose One, Mux Mool & more, our Austin debut of <em><a href="http://nidhogggame.com/">Nidhogg 2</a></em> stands to be one of 2017's best shows.</p>
