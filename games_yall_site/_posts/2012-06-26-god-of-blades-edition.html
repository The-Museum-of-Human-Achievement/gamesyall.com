<p>Where has the love for pulp paperback fantasy gone? It's gone directly into GOD OF BLADES, as you will soon see this <strong>Sunday, July 1st, at 4PM</strong>, as we present the swordfighting epic debut from local indie upstart <a href="http://whitewhalegames.com/">White Whale Games</a> at our thirteenth edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/336793659729948">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>White Whale ultra-succinctly describe the game as "a love-song to pulp fantasy tales of yore, 70s synth-prog-landscape oddities, and forgotten places", and we'll add more pointedly that it's one of the most satisfying real-physics swordfighters you've played in ages -- a 2D sidescroller that truly understands weight and rhythm.</p>

<p>White Whale will be on hand at the Highball to explain in greater detail how to make a game which distills swordplay and action to its core also touch more deeply on aspects of "memory, culture, and loss in terms of stories, books, and the communities that love them."</p>

<p>They'll also be premiering a new co-op survival mode of the game with a chance for you to win prizes like T-shirts and limited prints of the amazing custom pulp book covers they've created for the game, as above (see more of those <a href="http://whitewhalegames.com/gallery.html">in their gallery here</a>!).</p>
<p>Everything will be kicking off <strong>Sunday, July 1st, promptly at 4PM at The Highball, 1142 S Lamar Blvd, Austin, TX 78704</strong>! Come early to get a head-start on learning the game's rhythms, enjoy the Highball's Happy Hour drink specials, and say hello to the people changing the way you think about games!</p>
