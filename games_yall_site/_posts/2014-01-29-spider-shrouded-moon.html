<p>The original was <a href="http://venuspatrol.com/2009/08/touch-me-im-slick-the-silky-sl/">one of the first best games released on the App Store</a>, and now we're giving Austin the first look at its return: join us <strong>next Thursday, February 6th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents an evening with local indie studio <a href="http://blog.tigerstylegames.com/">Tiger Style</a>, as they pull back the curtain on their forthcoming game <em><a href="http://www.shroudedmoon.com/">Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon</a></em>. </p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1478215649072415">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p><em><a href="http://tigerstylegames.com/Spider/tsobm/">Spider: The Secret of Bryce Manor</a></em> was noteworthy for bringing the iPhone a game that wasn't simply a light time-killer. Peek just one layer beneath its friendly, approachable web-slinging mechanics, and it revealed an involved story of the former inhabitants of the manor, told entirely through the objects they left behind.</p>
<p>And Tiger Style carried that approach one step further with their iPhone & iPad follow-up <em><a href="http://www.wakingmars.com/">Waking Mars</a></em>, a game crafted to bring more mature, console-quality-type mechanics and storytelling to pocket-sized devices. </p>

<p>Now they're revisiting the world that put them on the map with <em>Rite of the Shrouded Moon</em>, a game that promises to bring back everything you loved about the original <em>Spider</em>, but with a massively expanded and richer world containing even more mysteries and magic.</p>
<p>Like their <a href="http://www.juegosrancheros.com/74/events/lost-mars-edition/">earlier JUEGOS RANCHEROS debut</a>, Tiger Style will be taking you on a guided tour through the development of <em>Shrouded Moon</em>, and tell you more about what they're trying to accomplish with its return, the research into secret societies & symbols that's inspired it, and what you can expect when the game launches later this year.</p>
<p>As usual, the meetup will be immediately followed by our pals at Texas-area chiptune showcase <a href="http://txchipmusic.com/">TX Chip</a> -- visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/647411975296904/">their page</a> for this month's full lineup of 8-bit wunderkind!</p>
<p>Doors will be open <strong>Thursday, February 6th, at 7:00PM at <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702</strong>! The show is free and open to all the public -- come drink, play, and meet the people changing the way you think about videogames!</p>
