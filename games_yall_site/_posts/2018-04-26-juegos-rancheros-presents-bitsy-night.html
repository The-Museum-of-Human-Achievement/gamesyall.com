<p>JUEGOS RANCHEROS is proud to present the first-ever BITSY NIGHT, this Thursday, May 3rd, at 7:00PM at Austinâ€™s North Door. An entire evening of marvelous, funny, sad, cute, and puzzly Bitsy games, curated by Becklespinax and our own Adam Saltsman.</p>
<p>[ RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1708744002552324/">HERE</a>! ]</p>
<p>Created by Adam LeDoux, Bitsy is a web-based tool for making little games and little worlds, where you explore and hang out and talk to people. Less really is more when it comes to Bitsy - a perfect example of the way constraints breed creativity.</p>

<p>Simple, accessible, and fun to use, Bitsy even has its own little art tools built in, as well as branching dialog controls, and the ability to move between rooms. It's a bit like Hypercard for Gameboy, or if Zelda had a level editor (and no swords).</p>

<p>Our guest curator this month is Becklespinax, who has personally assembled a fascinating cross-section of this new scene. If you want to see what it's all about, be sure to join us Thursday, May 3rd, at 7:00PM at North Door, 501 Brushy Street, Austin, TX 78702!</p>
