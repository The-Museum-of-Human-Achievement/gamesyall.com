<p>Ready to kick off 2016 with a night of firsts? Our first JUEGOS RANCHEROS meetup of the new year is also our first very special virtual reality presentation: join us this <strong>Thursday, January 7th, at 7:00PM</strong> at Austin's <a href="http://www.ndvenue.com/">North Door</a>, as JUEGOS RANCHEROS presents KOKOROMI's first-person puzzler, <em><a href="http://www.superhypercube.com/">SUPERHYPERCUBE</a></em>.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/450208761836785/">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>

<p>Making its debut on Sony's highly anticipated <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/">PlayStation VR platform</a>, KOKOROMI describes <em>SUPERHYPERCUBE</em> as a retro-future game in which you float through  virtual world, rotating a cluster of cubes to narrowly fit through an endless stream of form-fitting walls.</p>

<p>Inspired by the user interfaces and analog special effects of classic films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner & Xanadu, <em>SUPERHYPERCUBE</em> is one of our first favorite VR games, which has us as excited for the upcoming wave of new & more immersive games as anything else we've seen.</p>

<p>Members of <a href="http://www.kokoromi.org/">KOKOROMI</a> -- the videogames/art collective originally formed in Montreal in 2006 -- will be on hand for a short presentation, and to gently guide you through your first dip into the game's warm and analog world, previously only seen at special events like XOXO and the PlayStation Experience.</p>
