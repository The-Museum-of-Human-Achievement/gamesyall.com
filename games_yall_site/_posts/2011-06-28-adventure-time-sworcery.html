<p>What time is it? JUEGOS RANCHEROS TIME. <strong>This Sunday, July 3rd, at 4PM</strong>, we'll be kicking off the third edition of JUEGOS RANCHEROS at The Highball, in partnership with Fantastic Arcade! In a super special guest-star edition, this time around, we'll be live-chatting with none other than <a href="http://www.buenothebear.com/">Pendleton Ward</a>, creator of Cartoon Network's super amazing original series <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/adventuretime/index.html">ADVENTURE TIME</a>, and representatives from Toronto indies Superbrothers and Capy, creators of the brilliant hit iOS adventure game <a href="http://www.swordandsworcery.com/">SWORD & SWORCERY EP</a>, all at THE SAME TIME.</p>
<p>[ <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=210959538939550">RSVP FOR THIS EVENT AND INVITE YOUR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK BY CLICKING HERE!</a></strong> ]</p>
<p>If you follow the intersection between games, art & animation, there's very little chance you haven't already been acquainted with Adventure Time, but if you haven't, all it takes is basically one sitting to realize that the show was created and written by a lifelong and super enthusiastic videogame lovers. Magic +1 rings, perilous labyrinths & miniboss battles and a full-on episode where stars Finn & Jake are <a href="https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=689492644077&oid=321031023382">pulled directly into a videogame on their BMO console</a> (artwork by that episode's animator, <a href="http://www.jkart.net/">Ke Jiang</a>, below!), the series is drenched in the culture we've collectively grown up in.</p>

<p>In a special three-way live-chat, creator Ward will be joined by the team behind recent iPhone & iPad cult success SWORD & SWORCERY EP -- the adventure game from Toronto tri-force <a href="http://superbrothers.ca/">Superbrothers</a>, <a href="http://www.capybaragames.com/">Capy</a> and musician <a href="http://jimguthrie.org/">Jim Guthrie</a> -- and linked up to us back here at the Highball for a talk on how the art, animation and videogame worlds inspire and feed off each other, now more than ever. </p>
